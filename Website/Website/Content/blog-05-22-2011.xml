            Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
            reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
            clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
            width if the user is using shrink to fit.
            This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
            user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

        <title type='text'>Alvin Plantinga: Science and Religion</title>
        <content type='html'>Just seen a video of &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/9048111"&gt;Alvin Plantinga giving a talk on the conflict between science and religion&lt;/a&gt;.  In it he argues that science, particularly evolution, isn't in conflict with theistic belief, but in fact the opposite is true: naturalism and evolution are incompatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argument deals with three propositions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Naturalism&lt;/span&gt; (there's no such thing as God or anything like a god)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Evolution&lt;/span&gt; (human beings have come to be by virtue of the processes described in current evolutionary theory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;: Our cognitive faculties are &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;reliable&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. they produce beliefs that are for the most part true)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argument goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The probability of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;R &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;given &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;E &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;is low&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evolution selects for behaviour, not beliefs; it doesn't make a difference to evolution whether your beliefs are true or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;If you accept &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;, and also premise 1, then you have a defeater for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This defeater can't be defeated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;If you have a defeater for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;, then you have a defeater for any belief produced by your cognitive faculties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;One of the beliefs produced by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;your cognitive faculties is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Now obviously the crux of this argument is premise 1; if this is demonstrated to be true, then the rest of the argument follows logically.  Interestingly, this premise takes the form of an argument from ignorance:  Plantinga can't see a way for evolution to select for true beliefs, so it must be impossible for evolution to select for true beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I don't think it is a true argument from ignorance, as I think the burden of proof is on the evolutionist to demonstrate that evolution does select for true beliefs.  However, it is in the same vein, in the sense that it is dependent on the current state of scientific research - if at some point in the future science can demonstrate how evolution can select for true beliefs, then the argument fizzles away into nothingness.  In order to make the argument watertight, Plantinga must demonstrate that it is impossible for evolution to select for true beliefs, but he can only get as far as "I don't see how it is possible".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the questions in the Q&amp;amp;A session was: "Isn't it true that false beliefs can lead to maladaptive behaviour?"  This I think touches on something important.  Maybe we can't see how evolution can necessarily select for true beliefs, but it seems to me plausible that holding false beliefs in general would be maladaptive.  For example, if a creature evolved a neurostructure that as a side effect generated the belief "Crocodiles are nice friendly creatures", this neurostructure (and consequently the dependent belief) would be selected out of existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some of the error (as I would see it) comes into Plantinga's argument by his distinguishing between behaviour and belief, when he claims that evolution only selects for behaviour and not beliefs.  He seems to think that in the evolutionary model, beliefs are a mere side-effect of selecting for a neurostructure that produces certain behaviours.  Now with the simplest organisms, it is certainly true that evolution selects for certain behaviours (moving towards light, moving away from sudden shadows etc), but it doesn't make sense to talk about these organisms having any sort of beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are some very complex behaviours out there that appear to be purely reflex actions, for example I remember watching a David Attenborough documentary about a burrowing wasp that goes through a complex series of actions to check its burrow is clear.  The actions are completely hard-wired; if the wasp is interrupted in the middle of the process, it will start again from the beginning and will keep doing so as long as it is interrupted, until it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at some point there is a limit to the complexity of hard-wired actions that evolution can select for.  In order to react in real-time to a complex and rapidly changing environment, an organism must have a rudimentary model of the environment, at a level of complexity appropriate to the organism.  To a greater or lesser extent, this model will be built up by the organism through interaction with the environment itself, and through trial and error.  Hypotheses will be created and tested for, and either retained or discarded.  The actions and beliefs of the organism are thus interdependent, beliefs informing actions, and actions modifying beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With such a model, it seems to me more likely then that the opposite of premise 1 is true: given &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;, for a complex organism in a complex and rapidly changing environment, the probability of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;R &lt;/span&gt;is quite high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I think there's another problem with the argument, and it's quite subtle.  If &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;E &lt;/span&gt;are true, then according to Plantinga's argument, the cognitive faculties of any creature that have arisen by virtue of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;E &lt;/span&gt;are inherently untrustworthy.  However, even if you and I belong to that set of creatures, and our cognitive faculties cannot be trusted, that doesn't affect the truth of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;N &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;E &lt;/span&gt;in any way, it simply affects our ability to know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plantinga uses the following analogy to support premise 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose there is a substance XX which is such that you believe that if you take that substance, the probability is very high that your cognitive faculties will be unreliable.  Now suppose you also believe that you have taken it.  Well, then you've got a defeater for the belief that your cognitive faculties are reliable.  Even though you recognise it's possible that they could be, you've got a very good reason not to think that they are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all very well, but it seems to me the reasoning is faulty somewhere.  If you believe you have taken substance XX, then you have a defeater for the belief that your cognitive faculties are realiable.  But then you also have a defeater for the belief that you have taken substance XX!  In fact, as soon as you even believe that substance XX exists, instantly you have a defeater for the belief that your cognitive faculties are reliable, as you may have already taken it but believe not to have done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem here may be to do with failing to distinguish from belief about a proposition and the proposition itself, especially since the proposition itself is about what beliefs are possible.  I think there's a category error here somewhere, and I think it's possibly in step 3; what do you think?</content>

        <title type='text'>Intelligent Design</title>
        <content type='html'>One argument for the existence of God is that there are things in nature that are so complicated that they cannot have arisen by purely natural processes and so must have been designed by an intelligent agent (i.e. God).  I used to be a Creationist, and this argument resonated with me.  I won't talk about the creation/evolution debate right now, that's a subject for a later post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An counter-argument to the above could be to say that if the things which are designed are complicated, then the being who designed them must be more complicated still, so who designed the designer?  This counter-argument never used to persuade me at all - you can't ask "who designed God?" - God just is and that's all there is to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, recently I've come to understand the significance of it a bit more.  We are trying to resolve the issue of complexity in nature.  There is complexity, there is apparent design, we can see it all around us.  Where did it come from?  How can we explain it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two competing hypotheses here - a) it all arose through natural, mindless processes, or b) they are the result of intelligent agency.  We have to decide which of these hypotheses has the greater explanatory power.  The first hypothesis attempts to explain complexity by attributing it to the results of simpler, less complex forces (such as natural selection in biology - an observed and proven process, and gravity in cosmology).  The second attempts to explain complexity by attributing it to an intelligent agent, who must necessarily be more complex than the objects he/she/it is designing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's put it another way.  How can we explain the existence of intelligent beings?  Intelligence is presumably so complex a thing that it can only have been designed by an intelligent agent.  Does anyone spot the circular argument here?  We haven't explained the existence of intelligent beings at all, because our explanation involves invoking an intelligent being - an even more intelligent being, presumably.  We are back where we started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This however is not a problem for someone who believes in God, as they already have as their starting point an intelligent being, God, who they believe exists for reasons other than the design argument.  It's the easiest thing in the world to explain complexity in the world if you already believe there exists a being complex and powerful enough to create it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you see though that to someone who doesn't already believe in God this doesn't explain anything at all, and that someone who's really seeking an explanation for why things are the way they are will not value the design argument very highly?</content>

        <title type='text'>Justice and Mercy</title>
        <content type='html'>Two of the attributes I've heard attributed to God are Justice and Mercy. These are often held in conjunction with the claim that God is perfect, so all of the attributes he possesses, he holds in perfection: so God is perfectly just, and perfectly merciful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now am I incorrect in thinking that there's a contradiction here? How can God be perfectly just and perfectly merciful? Here are what seem to me to be obvious definitions of justice and mercy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Justice&lt;/span&gt;: getting what one deserves (whether positive or negative, i.e. punishment or reward)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mercy&lt;/span&gt;: not getting what one deserves (usually purely in a negative sense, i.e. being spared the punishment one deserves)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I've left open what it means to "deserve" a punishment or reward, and who decides this and what criteria they should use to judge. There are many different ideas and arguments here, but they don't affect the point I'm making, as justice and mercy come into effect after this decision has been made, however it is decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now following on from these definitions, what does it mean to be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;perfectly &lt;/span&gt;just or merciful? Well these qualities only have meaning when they're applied to one person concerning their treatment of another. So for God to be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;perfectly just&lt;/span&gt; in regard to humanity, it must follow that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;everyone will get what they deserve&lt;/span&gt;.  Likewise, for God to be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;perfectly merciful&lt;/span&gt;, it follows that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;no-one will get what they deserve&lt;/span&gt;, in terms of punishment. It seems to me obvious that should one single person not receive the punishment they deserve, perfect justice has not been observed. Likewise with perfect mercy, should one single person receive the punishment they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there we have the contradiction: God cannot be perfectly just and perfectly merciful. For if he were to be perfectly just, according to evangelical theology, everyone would go to Hell. Conversely, if he were perfectly merciful, no-one would go to Hell. Now this contradiction cannot be brushed aside in a claim that in some mysterious way both are true, because we are talking about the fate of real human beings. A single person cannot both be in Hell and not in Hell (and no arguments here for quantum superposition please!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we resolve this dilemma? Well there are two avenues open to us. One is to drop the idea that God is perfectly just and merciful; the other is to discard the doctrine that human beings deserve eternal punishment. The second avenue is the one I would recommend, but I think it is one evangelicals would be reluctant to go down, for obvious reasons. That leaves us with the first option, and I really don't see what would be hard about dropping this. After all, it's a core belief of evangelicalism that most people will receive some sort of punishment after death, but some will be forgiven. So why not just say that God is more just than he is merciful, in proportion to the number of people who are not forgiven as opposed to being forgiven? And leave it at that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, evangelicals will resort to another doctrine to attempt to resolve this contradiction: substitutionary atonement. God must be perfectly just and perfectly merciful, but this puts him in a dilemma, which he solves by punishing himself (i.e. Jesus, who is the Son of God, who is actually God) for the sins of humanity. Now this is an ingenious idea, but is simply a sleight of hand, as it distracts one from the central contradiction. Aside from the question of whether it is just to punish someone else, or even oneself, for the crimes of another, the issue is simply not resolved. For justice and mercy are qualities &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;which are shown to a particular person&lt;/span&gt;.  So if we take the example of a repentant sinner, who has accepted Christ's sacrifice for his sins (whatever that may mean), &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;has justice or mercy been shown to this person?  &lt;/span&gt;Obviously, he has been spared his punishment, so mercy has been shown to him.  Justice has not been shown &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;to him&lt;/span&gt;, as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;he has not recieved what he deserved&lt;/span&gt;.  So God has not been both perfectly just and perfectly merciful &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in his case&lt;/span&gt;, and so in the case of every person punished or forgiven by God.  So this doctrine resolves nothing.</content>

        <title type='text'>Debate: Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus</title>
        <content type='html'>I came across this debate today: &lt;a href="http://www.holycross.edu/departments/crec/website/resurrection-debate-transcript.pdf"&gt;Is There Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus?&lt;/a&gt; It's between Dr. William Lane Craig, Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, and Dr. Bart D. Ehrman, James A. Gray Distinguished&lt;br /&gt;Professor and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it fascinating. It's quite long (38 pages), but well worth the read if you're interested in the arguments for and against the resurrection. I don't think it does the topic justice, I'd like to see more arguments from each, with more cross-questioning, I don't think either of them answer all the questions they're posed by the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find myself coming down on the side of Ehrman (surprise surprise!) ; he does make some very good points. Firstly, that the gospels are not eyewitness accounts, but records of existing oral tradition, the reliability of which is dubious. Secondly, that resurrection is a theological explanation, not a historical one. There are many possible theological explanations for the resurrection, if it occurred - one could think of any number on the spot, and Dr. Ehrman suggests one in the debate.  How can we know that none of these explanations are true, but the Christian explanation is? The point is that theologians are free to debate the spiritual significance of an event, but this is not something that history&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can make any sort of judgement about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following on from that, Dr. Ehrman also asks Craig about other accounts of miracles from the time, such as Appolonius of Tyana - what historical basis is there for saying that these miracles happened? Craig as much as admits that there are none - in fact he brushes them aside as "myths and legends that have no historical value whatsoever". I'm surprised that he doesn't see that his statement can be easily turned around and applied to his own Christian miracle stories. He seems to me to have shot himself in the foot here. He, and many Christians like him, presuppose the truth of his own miracle traditions, while dismissing out of hand the miracle traditions of other religions. The resurrection of Jesus by God only becomes a valid possibility once one pressuposes God's existence (and more specifically: the existence of the God of the Judeo-Christian tradition). History has nothing to say on this topic, that's for theologians and philosophers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, read it for yourself, see what you think.</content>

        <title type='text'>The Argument from Morality</title>
        <content type='html'>One of the arguments for the existence of God is that morality is explained better by the existence of a God who formulates a moral code which is planted within us, than by any purely naturalistic explanation. If God does not exist, then where does our morality come from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophers have been puzzling for many years (centuries?) over this question, and there have been many attempts to come up with naturalistic theories of morality. Some of these theories are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;relativist &lt;/span&gt;theories, which say that there is no absolute right or wrong but that these are defined by the culture, personal or historical setting in which we are found. Others are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;utilitarian &lt;/span&gt;theories which define right actions as the actions which attempt to maximise (or minimise) a certain function over the population, for example, those actions which lead to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism_%28book%29"&gt;greatest happiness of the greatest number&lt;/a&gt;, or to the &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/about/bybarker/goodness.php"&gt;minimisation of harm&lt;/a&gt;.  Still others are variations of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/span&gt; (do unto others as you would have them do unto you), such as Kant's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant#Moral_philosophy"&gt;formulation&lt;/a&gt; that goes along the lines that you should only do those actions which you would be happy about being made a universal law. I'm sure there are many other theories out there, feel free to enlighten me if you know of any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with all these theories, according to the theist, is that whereas they may or may not give an accurate formulation of right or wrong, they still do not explain why we &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;should &lt;/span&gt;do what is right, however defined. For example, if it is wrong to kill a person to steal their money because the harm caused to society by the murder would outweigh the inconvenience to me of being less well off, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;why should I care &lt;/span&gt;about society as opposed to my own welfare?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are responses to this, for instance to say that I can never be sure that I won't get found out, which would in the long run be a greater inconvenience to me than having less money, whether it be by a prison sentence, or by being ostracised by society. Or alternatively, that psychologically I would be comparatively worse off, because of the person I had become, or the guilt I would suffer. But I don't think these are adequate, because we can always hypothesize a perfect crime, which would never be found out, or someone with no feeling of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is this an insurmountable problem for Naturalism then? That naturalistic theories of morality cannot adequately explain why we &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;should &lt;/span&gt;do what's right instead of what's wrong? Maybe, maybe not - I don't know. Maybe someone will come up with such a theory; maybe someone already has and I don't know about it. Maybe there never can be such a theory. However, I don't think that matters too much, because I don't think Theism can account for it either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's ask the theist: "Why should we do what's right instead of what's wrong?". The theist will probably respond along the lines that God has created a moral code for us, either written down in the Bible, or in our hearts, or probably both, and given us a conscience so that we know when we've done right or wrong. But then we can ask the question "but why &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;should &lt;/span&gt;we obey this moral code?" The thing is that whatever the theist responds, we can keep asking the question "but why should we do &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;?", until we eventually get to a selfish motive, or a mere assertion that "we just &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;!" The point being here, that neither of these is any more satisfactory than the naturalist position, the former being no different to the selfish motivation in naturalist theories, and the latter not answering the question at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's an example dialogue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Naturalist&lt;/span&gt;: Why should we obey the moral code?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Theist&lt;/span&gt;: Because God commands us to obey it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Naturalist&lt;/span&gt;: But why should we obey God?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theist now has the option here of saying "we just should", or giving a selfish motive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Theist&lt;/span&gt;: Because if you disobey God, he will punish you, and if you obey him, he will reward you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Theist&lt;/span&gt;: Because God knows what is best for you and this is the only way for you to be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so on... whatever response the theist gives, it can be reduced to either a selfish motive, question-begging, or an opportunity for another "why should we do &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;?" question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, that naturalistic moral theories cannot explain the 'should' of morality should not be a huge problem for Naturalism, as Theism cannot account for it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

        <title type='text'>Who is more moral?</title>
        <content type='html'>Quick question, your thoughts please:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other things being equal, who is the more moral person?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Someone who has a strong desire to do evil, but resists it and does good instead,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Someone who has no desire whatsoever to do evil, and does good simply because he/she knows nothing else.</content>

        <title type='text'>The Tale of the Twelve Officers</title>
        <content type='html'>The problem of evil (see &lt;a href="http://stusmusings.blogspot.com/2005/10/free-will-1-problem-of-evil.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) can be briefly summed up as being the problem of why, if God is all-good and all-powerful, should evil exist.  Theologians have come up with many ingenious ways to get around this problem (e.g. free will, needing evil to appreciate good, etc), which tend mostly to abstract evil as being a general concept, which can then be regarded dispassionately as a means to a greater end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, regardless of the plausibility or implausibility of these arguments, for me the problem comes in applying them to any specific instance of evil.  If any of us had God's knowledge of an event, and his power to intervene, would we stand by and do nothing?  An example could be the September 11th attack - if you personally knew such an event was going to happen, would you not do all that was in your power to prevent it?  And if you did not do all you could, would you not be judged as guilty by your inaction?  How much more so then God, whose knowledge is perfect and power is infinite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this article the other day: &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/five.html"&gt;The Tale of the Twelve Officers&lt;/a&gt;, which takes all the arguments I have heard to try and justify God's apparent inaction in the face of evil, and places them in the setting of a particular evil act.  I challenge anyone to accept any of the arguments given by the officers in the story as being remotely justifiable excuses for inaction in the face of a specific evil act.</content>

        <title type='text'>Objective Morality</title>
        <content type='html'>Just a quick one for now: Is morality objective?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If morality is objective, then something is right or wrong regardless of whatever intelligent beings decide. God is an intelligent being. Therefore if morality is objective, something is right or wrong &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;regardless of whether or not God decides it to be so&lt;/span&gt;.  Thus God does not decide what is right or wrong, he merely communicates what he knows to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm guessing that most Christians will find that conclusion difficult to accept: of course God has a say in what is right or wrong, he's the Creator isn't he? OK, so let's make morality contingent. Well, bang goes the argument for the existence of God on the basis of objective morality!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if we're trying to understand morality, if morality is contingent, it could just as easily have been created by humans as by God. By Occam's principle, it is foolish to invoke a more complex explanation when a simple one will do. We must first look for a purely naturalistic explanation of morality, and only turn to a supernatural explanation when a naturalistic explanation is proven not to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, if morality is objective, then God cannot be invoked as an explanation, as this gets us nowhere.</content>

He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. &lt;span id="en-NIV-6860" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD : "If you give the Ammonites into my hands, &lt;span id="en-NIV-6861" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span id="en-NIV-6862" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into his hands.&lt;span id="en-NIV-6863" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim.

She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. &lt;span id="en-NIV-6865" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, "Oh! My daughter! You have made me miserable and wretched, because I have made a vow to the LORD that I cannot break." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span id="en-NIV-6866" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"My father," she replied, "you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me just as you promised, now that the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. &lt;span id="en-NIV-6867" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But grant me this one request," she said. "Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;"You may go," he said. And he let her go for two months. She and the girls went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. After the two months, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judges 11:29-39 (NIV)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Was Jephthah right to sacrifice his daughter to fulfill a vow?

        <title type='text'>Free Will 2: Sinlessness and Perfection</title>
        <content type='html'>Let's have another look at the free-will argument. This attempts to resolve the problem of evil (see previous post) by saying that for humans to make moral choices, they must be morally free. This requires the possibility of choosing good and the possibility of choosing evil. The point I made in the previous post was that just because it is possible for a moral agent to choose evil, this does not mean that this possibility need ever be realised. After all, all things being equal, there would be no reason for a perfect being to do evil, as the good choice would always be the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to follow up this argument by illustrating two examples from within Christianity that show it is possible for there to be free moral agents that never commit evil, and hopefully demonstrate that the mere possibility of evil is not sufficient to explain its actual existence in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Example #1: Jesus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Christianity, Jesus was completely sinless. However, traditional Christianity also claims that Jesus, while being fully human, was also fully God, and that he was not affected with original sin. Now these other claims about Jesus might at first glance appear to invalidate a comparison between Jesus and moral agents such as you and I, but I think we can cut through these apparent difficulties by asking this question: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Did Jesus have free will? &lt;/span&gt;If the answer to this is no, then Jesus was not a free moral agent, and we can disregard this example. However, I do not know any Christians who would say that Jesus did not have free will! So I think we can safely claim that Jesus was a free moral agent, and in that respect, the comparison holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I was a Christian having an intense discussion with someone from my church about whether or not Jesus could have sinned. The Bible says that Jesus was tempted to sin on many occasions, and even says he was "tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). I was trying to argue that Jesus could have sinned but didn't, because if he couldn't have sinned then he couldn't have been tempted by sin, and the claim that Jesus was actually tempted is vital to many Christian doctrines, including that of him being an example to us of how to resist temptation. The person I was arguing with claimed that Jesus couldn't have sinned, because he was God and God cannot sin, therefore when the Bible says he was tempted, it doesn't mean that he was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;actually tempted&lt;/span&gt;, just that he was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;tested &lt;/span&gt;to see what his response would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, did Jesus have the ability to sin? Was it possible that he could have done evil? If not, then Jesus was not a free moral agent, and had no free will with regard to moral choices. If so, and yet he never actually did any evil, what is the difference between Jesus, the free moral agent, and Adam, the free moral agent. Both were in a position of perfection, having no "original sin" to bias their choices towards evil. What did Jesus have that Adam didn't have? If Jesus was free in all ways that Adam was free, how did Adam go wrong? If Jesus had something that Adam didn't have, that enabled him to resist temptation more effectively, how can Jesus be said to be an example of how to resist temptation, if he had an unfair advantage? And why did God not give this advantage to Adam?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Example #2: Heaven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Heaven there is no sin; this is part of the definition of Heaven. So what of its inhabitants (i.e. dead Christians)? Are they free moral agents? If so, I repeat the questions of the previous paragraph: What is the difference between free moral agents in Heaven and free moral agents on Earth? If the occupants of Heaven are free moral agents, it is possible for them to sin, and yet they do not. In fact, since Heaven is eternal, if its occupants make moral choices, they must make an infinite number of moral choices and always choose the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Heaven's inhabitants are not morally free, this raises some interesting questions about the value of free will. If, as is to be supposed, the state of man in Heaven is God's desired state for the human race, then free will is surely only a means to an end, which end is purity without free will. The whole free-will answer to the problem of evil collapses if this is the case, as it now seems that free will is not as important to God as is claimed, since man's ultimate, eternal state is one of a morally pure, non-morally-free being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard it argued that those in Heaven are those who have, out of their own free will, chosen to have their free will revoked, the important point being that they used their free will to get there. This smells very fishy to me. Firstly, why would a being with free will choose to give it up? I can see no reason other than that of having no other choice (i.e. a choice between eternal punishment with free will or eternal bliss without free will). This seems very wrong to me: what kind of God would create beings with free will, and then give them the choice of revoking their free will or being eternally punished? Secondly, it severely diminishes the value of free will, as it implies that for a being to exist in a state of perfection, it must have no free will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it be argued that there is no sin in Heaven because there are no actual moral choices to make, perhaps because there is no temptation to sin, then that raises the question of why there was temptation in the Garden of Eden. If man's state in Heaven is God's desired state for all of us, Adam and Eve included, then why not bypass the whole temptation -&gt; sin -&gt; judgement -&gt; salvation process and just create it like that in the first place? Anyway, if there were no temptation to sin in Heaven, there would be no possibility of making an evil choice, which would mean that those in Heaven would not be morally free agents, which conclusion again lends itself to the objections raised earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given these two examples in Christianity of sinless, morally free agents (given that I have sufficiently demonstrated that they are in fact morally free), I conclude that there is no reason to suppose that the possibility of evil for a morally free agent in any way determines that evil will actually occur, and so the free-will objection to the problem of evil does not hold.</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Tim, thanks for your post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know, I have heard all of these arguments before.  The thing is, I find them unsatisfactory.  Here are my objections:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Saying that man is an infinite being does not get around the fact that the sins he is being judged for are finite, as they have been committed in a finite amount of time.  This was my original point - hardly a technicality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. How can anything finite have infinite consequences?  The only way for this to happen is for God to</content>

        <title type='text'>Hell</title>
        <content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;There's no-one in Hell now that didn't choose to be there&lt;/blockquote&gt;Someone said that to me once.  I disagree, and this is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's assume for now that Hell does exist.  Now, Hell, so we're told, is a horrible place, to put it mildly.  In fact it is the most horrible place, at least according to tradition.  I think most Christians would agree that no-one who'd actually seen Hell would actively choose to go there.</content>

        <title type='text'>Free Will 1: The Problem of Evil</title>
        <content type='html'>The problem of evil is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. God is all-good.&lt;br /&gt;2. An all-good being would do everything in his/her power to eliminate evil.&lt;br /&gt;3. God is all-powerful.&lt;br /&gt;4. Therefore, evil should not exist.&lt;br /&gt;5. We know that evil does exist.&lt;br /&gt;6. Therefore, if God exists, he is either not all-good, or not all-powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the atheist, this is case closed: there is no God. Or if there is, he is either not all-good or not all-powerful, and what sort of God is that! Certainly not the God of Christianity, at any rate. On the other hand, for the theist, this is a challenge to come up with a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;theodicy &lt;/span&gt;- an explanation of why, if God were all-good and all-powerful, he would choose to let evil remain. In order to be an adequate response, this explanation must be consistent with itself and with the belief system of which it is a part, and also with the world as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious route for the theist is to qualify statement 2 above thus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. An all-good being would do everything in his/her power to eliminate any particular evil, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; doing so would result in a greater evil&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, or the loss of a good greater than the mere absence of the first evil&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This qualification would then therefore imply that the evil that we see in the world is in fact unavoidable, in order to achieve a greater good or to prevent a greater evil. The rejoinder to this is to ask: what is this greater good that evil must be tolerated in order to achieve; or what evil could be worse than that which we see around us every day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One widely accepted argument in theistic circles is that there is a greater good: that of free will. In this view, God values one thing above all others, and that is man's ability to freely choose between good and evil. To put it starkly: a Hitler's ability to choose his own actions is of more value to God than the prevention of the suffering of concentration-camp-fuls of innocent people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the free-will argument explains the existence of evil is to say that for an agent to be morally free requires there to be the possibility of doing good, and the possibility of doing evil. We can put it this way: if an agent A is presented with a choice C between a good action a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and an evil action a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then if it is impossible for A to choose a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then A is not morally free with regard to C. Thus for humans to be morally free agents, there must be the possibility of doing evil actions.  Therefore there must be evil in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The argument makes perfect sense right until that last sentence. For humans to be morally free requires the possiblity of committing evil; agreed. But that doesn't mean that the possibility need ever be realised. If the morally good choice is always the best choice, for the agent or for the population, then surely a fully-informed, totally free, intelligent, conscious agent will always choose the moral good; to do otherwise would make no sense whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, that's not the human race that you and I know.  So what went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aha," says the theodicist, warming to the argument, "this is where the Fall comes in. You see, God created Adam and Eve perfect and morally free. They had a moral choice between a evil action (eating the fruit) and a good action (not eating it), but they chose the evil. So that's when sin entered the world. And now we're all sinners because we have a bias towards choosing evil."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, it all makes sense ... hang on, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I thought they were perfect and morally free. &lt;/span&gt; And I just argued that for someone in that position to do anything other than the moral good would be nonsense.  So why&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; did &lt;/span&gt;they choose the evil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Answer #1: They were tempted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So? Before the Fall, humans had no bias towards evil. So there would be no irresistable urge to choose the wrong action. So temptation would have no power, because however attractive an option might seem in the short term, the perfect, morally free human would &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;always &lt;/span&gt;choose the good, no matter what the temptation, simply because it's the better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Answer #2: The Devil deceived them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm. OK, we can't see any way perfect beings could choose evil, so let's postulate an essentially evil entity which temporarily assumes power over them and convinces them to do something which they would never choose to do otherwise... Leaving aside the question of where this guy came from, and how &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;he &lt;/span&gt;became evil, where was God at this time? What was God doing letting this smooth talking, evil being wander about in his paradise? This being with the power to completely deceive innocent humans into doing something completely irrational and with such disastrous consequences? Because it stands to reason, given that perfect, morally free agents would always choose the best course of action, the Devil must have interfered with their reasoning processes. Which means that it was not their fault. Which means it was the Devil's. Which means, ultimately, it was God's, for letting him in in the first place.</content>

        <title type='text'>Logic Example: The Rock Paradox</title>
        <content type='html'>This was originally part of the previous post, but I thought it was a bit too long, so I split it into two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can demonstrate the power of logic by resolving a so-called problem of God's omnipotence. Most people have encountered the question 'Can God create a rock he cannot lift?' The paradox is obvious: if God is omnipotent, he can create anything. So then God &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;can &lt;/span&gt;create a rock he can't lift. But then he can't lift it, so there's something he can't do, so he's not omnipotent after all. But then if God &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;can't &lt;/span&gt;create an object he cannot lift, then that's something God can't do, so he's not omnipotent. Conclusion: God is not omnipotent; but if God was not omnipotent, he couldn't be God; so God as we define him doesn't exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see if we can help God get out of this mess, using logic. First, we can define omnipotence in terms of lifting and creating things. If God is omnipotent, he can create anything. We can formulate this as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. GodIsOmnipotent ⇒ ∀x : GodCanCreate(x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This simply means: The statement 'God is omnipotent' implies that for all (∀ means 'for all') objects x, God can create x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next: if God is omnipotent, he can lift anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. GodIsOmnipotent ⇒ ∀x : GodCanLift(x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the rules of logic is this: (A ⇒ B ∧ A ⇒ C) ⇒ (A ⇒ B ∧ C). This means, if A implies B, and A implies C, then A implies both B and C. We can use this rule to combine the two statements above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. GodIsOmnipotent ⇒ ∀x : GodCanCreate(x) ∧ ∀x : GodCanLift(x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can use another rule of logic to combine two 'for all' statements: (∀x : P(x) ∧ ∀x : Q(x)) ⇒ (∀x : P(x) ∧ Q(x)), giving us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. GodIsOmnipotent ⇒ ∀x : GodCanCreate(x) ∧ GodCanLift(x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we can make our first statement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. GodIsOmnipotent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can use our rules of logic on this (if A is true, and A implies B, then B is true) to get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. ∀x : GodCanCreate(x) ∧ GodCanLift(x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we can make our next statement:  God can create a rock that he cannot lift.  We can express it in this way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. ∃c : GodCanCreate(c) ∧ ¬GodCanLift(c)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means: There exists (∃ means 'there exists') a particular object c (our rock), such that it is the case that God can create c, but it is not the case that God can lift c. This is our contentious statement. Using another rule of logic, we can move from the general to the particular (∀x : P(x) ⇒ ∃c : P(c)). Using this on statement 6, we get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. ∃c : GodCanCreate(c) ∧ GodCanLift(c)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now we have a contradiction! Statement 7 contradicts statement 8. But we know that if we come to a contradiction, we have made a meaningless set of statements. So the statement 'God is omnipotent and can create a rock that he cannot lift' is, in fact, gibberish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the statement 'God is omnipotent and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cannot &lt;/span&gt;create a rock that he cannot lift'?  This can be expressed as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.   GodIsOmnipotent&lt;br /&gt;10.  ∃c : ¬GodCanCreate(c) ∧ ¬GodCanLift(c)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which obviously leads to another contradiction. So this statement is meaningless too. The correct conclusion is not that God is not omnipotent, but that it does not make sense to talk of a rock that God can create but cannot lift. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;There is no such rock&lt;/span&gt;.  This is not saying that God cannot create it, but saying that such a rock &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cannot exist&lt;/span&gt;, as much as a 'square circle' cannot exist.</content>

        <title type='text'>Logic and Christianity</title>
        <content type='html'>Hello everybody.  I've finally got round to posting again - only two months since the last one.  What can I say, I'm a busy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few thoughts here about logic. Somebody asked me the other day why Christianity needed to be logically consistent - why do I think that we can use human logic to talk about spiritual things? What if God's logic is different to our logic? Can't God do the impossible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are probably many people who hold the belief that God's logic is higher than our logic, so we shouldn't use logic when talking about God. However, this simply demonstrates that they don't understand what logic is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, off the top of my head, these are my ideas on what logic is; please let me know if they hold together. Logic is a way of using language to talk about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;the way things are&lt;/span&gt;. Logicians put forward definitions of terms, make statements about them, and then use rules to manipulate these statements. The key is that these statements are made in a rigorous language which eliminates ambiguity. The rules are themselves definitions which are self-evident. For instance, the rule of 'And' goes something like this: For a statement of the form 'X is true AND Y is true' to be true, both X and Y have to be true. The 'And' rule is an axiom of logic. God's 'And' cannot be different to our 'And', because then it would not be 'And', it would be something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So within the realm of things that can be expressed in the language of logic, logic reigns supreme. The grey area is in formulating our definitions. Once we hit on definitions in the language of logic of terms that everyone agrees on, we can proceed to use the rules to manipulate statements using these definitions. The beautiful thing about logic, and the key to it's power, is that the rules are so simple and so self-evident; so much so, that if I can manipulate a (minimal) set of statements using the rules, and come to two contradictory conclusions, then the original (minimal) set of statements is not only wrong, but &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;meaningless&lt;/span&gt;.  For an example, see the &lt;a href="#112591182008458382"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the question about whether logic can be used to talk about spiritual things can be reduced to the question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we formulate definitions that everyone agrees on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the hard part, and where all the fun lies; theologians have been quibbling about definitions for thousands of years. Once we have done this, logic can be used to powerfully weed out any contradictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point about logic: The only way logic can decide the truth of a statement is if it is logically inconsistent. Upon statements which are not inconsistent, logic has no opinion. For example, logic can say things like 'If Pegasus exists, then it can fly'. The truth or falsity of the statement 'Pegasus exists' has to come from outside logic. Only if it is logically inconsistent for Pegasus to fly can logic prove Pegasus not to exist. And this is where this blog comes in. Christianity (or a subset of it's tenets) may or may not be true. But if it's logically inconsistent, then it can't be true.</content>

        <title type='text'>Eternity &amp; Consciousness</title>
        <content type='html'>Thanks to everyone for their comments so far. Keep them coming. There's some interesting and challenging stuff there, which I will reply to as soon as I've had time to think deeply enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Adair in his comment to the last post highlighted the difficulty of conceptualising existence outside of time. This is something I have thought about before, and I'd like to present my thoughts on the matter for general dissection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first point I should make is that our ability to imagine or conceptualise something to any degree of success is independent of its actually being true. For instance, in physics, String Theory requires space to have 9 dimensions (I think the latest development, M theory, requires 10 space dimensions). Now, I find it incredibly difficult to imagine there being more than three dimensions of space. However, it is obvious that if String Theory is proven to be true, this will be independent of, and in spite of, my ability to visualise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is important to draw the distinction between something that is hard to visualise and something that is just nonsense. I also find it extremely difficult to visualise a four-sided triangle, but more detailed analysis of that concept will reveal its self-contradictory nature. The point I'm making is that there are many things that are hard to conceptualise in theology, but we must work hard to elucidate which of these things can be consistently held, if not visualised, and which are self-contradictory. Most importantly, when we discover an idea that is self-contradictory, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;we must discard it&lt;/span&gt;, no matter what theological edifices are resting on its foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, although I find it hard to understand, I find nothing inherently inconsistent with the idea of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;something &lt;/span&gt;existing outside of time. What I do have a problem with is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;conscious beings&lt;/span&gt; existing outside of time. That is to say, for the purposes of this argument I will admit to the possibility of a person &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;existing &lt;/span&gt;outside of time in either Heaven or Hell (although whether these places are outside of space is another matter). What I take issue with is the idea that they can &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;know &lt;/span&gt;anything about it one way or the other.  I aim to show in this post that this is inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;consciousness is a process.&lt;/span&gt; Whatever the ancients thought about the soul or mind being separate from the body, the more we study consciousness, the more inseparably linked it appears to be with a physical brain, and thus a physical process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consciousness involves at least three things: perception, memory of the perception, and the connection of the memory of the perception with ourselves in some conceptual way. Perception need not necessarily be of an external stimulus, it could also be of a mental state or process. Memory is the key here - without memory (whether long- or short-term) it is impossible to be aware of anything. Without memory, everything is static, stationary, time-instances; there is no ability to connect any arbitrary instant of time with any other - this can only be done with memory to string them together and make sense of them. And finally, it is only once we have the memory of the perception that we are in any way able to relate it to ourselves, in other words, exhibit consciousness. (Note that although here the three stages, perception, memory and relation, are each separated by a time gap, this gap is so small that we are unaware of the stages themselves. In fact, since these three stages &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;define &lt;/span&gt;awareness, we can never actually be aware of them taking place)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after having established memory as being essential to consciousness, we can now go on to see how time is essential to memory. Memory is storing information. The act of storing information is the arrangement of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;something &lt;/span&gt;into a meaningful state.  But this is a process.  It &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;happens&lt;/span&gt;. It is an event. Events happen in time. It is meaningless to talk of an event outside of time: this is the definition of an event. At time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;something &lt;/span&gt;is arranged in less meaningful state s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  At time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;something &lt;/span&gt;is arranged in more meaningful state s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, consciousness requires memory, memory is storing information, storing information is an event in time; therefore consciousness requires time. Therefore, to speak of consciousness outside of time is meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This applies not only to humans, but to any supposedly conscious being, including God. Without time, consciousness does not exist, because consciousness &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;happens&lt;/span&gt;, and things only happen in time. Therefore, God is either not conscious, or needs time as much as you or I do. Also, any idea of eternity which involves us consciously experiencing it must take the form of an infinite length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, it's 4:03. I'm going to bed.</content>

        <title type='text'>Hell</title>
        <content type='html'>Why not start with a biggie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I think about the idea of Hell, the more silly it sounds. Most definitions of Hell involve the idea of eternal punishment for sins, or a place of eternal suffering. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that if a definition of Hell doesn't include the idea of eternal suffering, then it's not a definition of Hell, but of something else. Whether this suffering is direct or indirect, physical, psychological or spiritual is not the issue here. Suffering is suffering, whatever form it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans are finite creatures, who live for a finite period of time. Within this period of time, they can carry out a finite number of actions, each of which with finite consequences. Consequently, a single person can commit only a finite amount of sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If justice entails meting an amount of sin with an appropriate amount of punishment (notice the "if" - we can quibble about this idea of justice later), and if God is perfectly just, then punishment in Hell has to equate to punishment for an infinite amount of sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If no man can commit an infinite amount of sin, and some humans end up in Hell, then we have a contradiction. One of our premises above is wrong. Either a) God is not perfectly just; or b) Hell does not involve eternal suffering; or c) a single, finite, human being can in fact commit an infinite amount of sin; or d) no human will ever end up in Hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is it to be?</content>

I have found God's existance proved in many various ways some that you may pishaw off as coincidence. You will have to use your own tests. Gidion used fleeces. I will tell you of one that showed me God's power and proof of his existance (to me anyway) 5 years ago my husband and i were in a head on crash. I came to, seeing incredible damage. slowly checking my own damages. i checked out the damages around me but i fearfully refused to look at my husband's side of the truck. I felt that he couldn't have survived. While i looked around i realised i was buried to the waist in the gravel we were hauling in the back. we had hit with such force the gravel had ripped through the bed and through the back of the cab destroying the back seat and obliterating everything in the back of the cab. Turning around my eyes came to rest on my son's bible resting on top of the dirt faceup rightside up undamaged. And i felt real peace that everything was going to be OK. That was when i could look at my husband and ask him if he was alright. He was shocky and had broken his femur. But really OK. When you find something that gives you that kind of peace. you will find the existance of God.</content>

        <title type='text'>The necessary "being" is actually a logical necess...</title>
        <content type='html'>The necessary "being" is actually a logical necessity, not just logically possible.  If anything exists as a cause now (which there are obviously many), then there must be a "beginning" cause that would thus be uncaused.  It would have to be self-existent.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The reason is because of the difference between an imagined "infinite" (i.e. mathematical infinite numbers) and an actual infinite (all but unimaginable).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If reality (our cause an effect scenario) went infinitely backward in time, then cause/effect would have been unable to transverse that infinity of causes to get to "here".  It's like trying to go to the beginning of an infinitely long book shelf and putting a book on the end of it.  You'd never get there.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;stu, you are making a common false comparison between God and the created.  Several scientific and logical proofs exist for the singularity of the Universe's beginning (I will list them if needed).  If the universe began, that makes it an effect.  If it is an effect, it needed a &lt;I&gt;sufficient&lt;/I&gt; cause.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Since time began at the beginning of the Universe (it's the 4th dimension, remember), then it began at or after the beginning of the Universe, thus the cause of the Universe is not bound by time.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Since (outside of &lt;I&gt;a priori&lt;/I&gt; rejection of supernaturalism) design is apparent, and since we see a necessary cause of the Universe, we can safely conclude that the cause of the universe was sufficient to cause the design we see in nature.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If this cause is self-existent (which is a must), then we can also safely conclude that its intelligence (sufficiency to design)is self-existent.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In your quandry (and other related quandries such as "who made God?), there is a fundamental misunderstanding of cause/effect and of the implications of the beginning of the universe.  The "Cause" of the Universe (by necessity seperate from  the universe) is not under the constraints of the universe.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;With all of that said, it is my proposition that the God of the Bible best fits the needed "cause".&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Take care, and God bless...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;PS.  I just wanted to say how much I respect your "about me" comments.  I encourage you to keep your mind open and seeking.  Moreso, I encourage you to approach God with your dillima.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Mark 9:24-- Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"&lt;/I&gt;</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;To me it is just as mental to think the universe and everything in it just came into being on its own. And just as crazy to think that an all powerful being created it all.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Maybe not. To think that the universe came into being on it's own is to say it created itself. If it created itself, it existed before it existed. That's not just crazy but logically impossible. That the universe was created by what the philosophers call a necessary being might be considered crazy by some, but it's not logically impossible.</content>

        <content type='html'>We exist in the present.&lt;BR/&gt;We observe in the present.&lt;BR/&gt;'Designer' or 'no designer' pre-observable past.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In the begining 'Designer' or In the begining 'nothing'?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As you say these are the only two options as other reasonings only serve to postpone the inevitable. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have some issues which I cannot resolve, the first when I try to understand 'nothing', no time, no space, no matter. I find the concept of nothingness so foreign to me that I cannot comprehend its logic.&lt;BR/&gt;Next we have a singularity - an explosion that has never been observed to be repeated, the cause of which cannot be explained, that provided the building blocks for everything we see today. I think that there are one or two assumptions made here and yet it is marketed as the answer to the logic of 'scientific proof'.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You will have guessed I believe in the Designer model. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What do we observe? &lt;BR/&gt;The tendency is towards decay - nothing gets any better than when it is new, items wear away until they're unfit for use.&lt;BR/&gt;Speciation and natural selection typically reduce the variety of information passed on to subsequent generations, information loss. Sibblings don't marry because of the increased probability of passing on 'faulty' genes. However, even where extra information is passed on it is with detremental effect (Down's Syndrome is the addition of an extra chromosome - 47 instead of 46 - see www.intellectualdisability.info/diagnosis/downs_syndrome.htm [accessed 28-07-07]).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;'Designer' or 'no designer'?&lt;BR/&gt;As mentioned earlier these are the two diametrically opposed possiblilities, neither disprovable by observable science and yet one must be right.&lt;BR/&gt;As you recognise in the 'Designer' model, if you require a designer of the designer you ultimately need the Ultimate Designer to pre-exist (postponing the inevitable).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So what conclusion do I arrive at? &lt;BR/&gt;The Designer model - requires belief in a pre-existing designer and the resulting respect towards the designer.&lt;BR/&gt;The nothingness model - requires belief in the concept of nothing, no reason, no purpose, no good, no bad and no concience.&lt;BR/&gt;Which of the models best fits observations?</content>

        <content type='html'>This is a very complicated subject. To me it is just as mental to think the universe and everything in it just came into being on its own. And just as crazy to think that an all powerful being created it all. I think the argument can look just as impossible no matter how you look at it. If there was no creator than how did the universe come into existance and what was before that and how did the stuff get here that created the universe. Same thing as God created the universe. Then where did God come from and who created him..............Which arguement is better or makes more sense....................neither and both.</content>

        <content type='html'>There comes a point where human reasoning becomes pure folly.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The Bible makes no attempt to explain God (Genesis 1 v 1), but assumes His existence as a starting point (Hebrews 11 v 6).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Creation declares God’s glory (Psalm 19) and if we use this evidence aright, we are brought to acknowledge our poverty in reasoning and smallness of being (Psalm 8).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The God of creation calls Himself Jehovah – the One which ever is (at whatever point we select), which ever was (admitting no starting point) and which ever is to come (admitting no end point).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The eternity of His Being cannot be compromised by the theories of puny, created men who (a) like to delve into that which is beyond them and (b) refuse to acknowledge His revealed claims.</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;Firstly, who isn't trying to explain organised complexity in general?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Well, the person who seeks to explain the appearance of design in nature is asking a specific question. Their question may be part of a broader set of questions, but I think Plantinga is pointing out that the Design Argument is a distinct and limited piece of that set.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Indulge me for a minute while I backtrack. The Design Argument goes something like this:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;P1 - There is a great deal of apparent design in nature.&lt;BR/&gt;P2 - This apparent design is either the product of chance or intellegent design.&lt;BR/&gt;P3 - It is not the product of chance.&lt;BR/&gt;C - Therefore, this &lt;I&gt;apparent&lt;/I&gt; design is &lt;I&gt;actual&lt;/I&gt; design.&lt;BR/&gt;C+ - Actual design requires an actual intelligent designer.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;To ask who designed the designer, without addressing the two options on the table (in P2), is not &lt;I&gt;rebutting&lt;/I&gt; the Design Argument but &lt;I&gt;sidestepping&lt;/I&gt; it. The &lt;I&gt;origin&lt;/I&gt; of intelligence and the &lt;I&gt;manifestation&lt;/I&gt; of intelligence are two different issues requiring (at least) two different arguments.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;While your question about the origin of intelligence is valid, I think you've improperly blamed the Design Argument for not answering it.</content>

        <content type='html'>Thanks for that link laughing boy - very interesting reading, I wasn't aware that Plantinga had reviewed Dawkins. I've bookmarked it for further reading, might write a post in response to it later. I've got The Dawkins Delusion by Alister McGrath - looks interesting, will read it when I've finished The God Delusion.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Two things though.  Firstly, who isn't trying to explain organised complexity in general?  Plantinga?  Of course it's perfectly valid to explain the tractors in terms of intelligent life, if you're just seeking an explanation for the tractors.  If you're seeking an explanation for intelligence itself, as I said in my post, then that answer doesn't help at all!  Where did the intelligent beings who designed the tractors come from?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If we wanted to, we could suggest that aliens had created intelligent life on this planet through a form of guided evolution (something like in 2001: A Space Odyssey), but that only moves the problem back a step in the causal chain:  who designed the aliens?  If God designed the aliens, then who designed God?  It's a perfectly reasonable question to ask, given that we are looking for an explanation of intelligence.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Of course it is possible that God exists and that he did design intelligent life;  I'm not denying that.  Not even Richard Dawkins denies it's a possibility, it's simply to him a very remote one.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, if we go back to my post, I'm simply saying that in terms of explanatory power, the design hypothesis is lacking.  And the design hypothesis is often put forward as the proof of the existence of God &lt;I&gt;because&lt;/I&gt; of its supposed explanatory power, often accompanied by sound-bites like "there's no such thing as a free lunch", and "how could life come from non-life?"</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;How can we explain the existence of intelligent beings? Intelligence is presumably so complex a thing that it can only have been designed by an intelligent agent.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;From &lt;A HREF="http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html" REL="nofollow"&gt;The Dawkins Confusion: Naturalism ad absurdum&lt;/A&gt; by Alvin Plantinga.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Suppose we land on an alien planet orbiting a distant star and discover machine-like objects that look and work just like tractors; our leader says "there must be intelligent beings on this planet who built those tractors." A first-year philosophy student on our expedition objects: "Hey, hold on a minute! You have explained nothing at all! Any intelligent life that designed those tractors would have to be at least as complex as they are." No doubt we'd tell him that a little learning is a dangerous thing and advise him to take the next rocket ship home and enroll in another philosophy course or two. For of course it is perfectly sensible, in that context, to explain the existence of those tractors in terms of intelligent life, even though (as we can concede for the moment) that intelligent life would have to be at least as complex as the tractors. The point is we aren't trying to give an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, and we aren't trying to explain organized complexity in general; we are only trying to explain one particular manifestation of it (those tractors). And (unless you are trying to give an ultimate explanation of organized complexity) it is perfectly proper to explain one manifestation of organized complexity in terms of another. Similarly, in invoking God as the original creator of life, we aren't trying to explain organized complexity in general, but only a particular kind of it, i.e., terrestrial life. So even if (contrary to fact, as I see it) God himself displays organized complexity, we would be perfectly sensible in explaining the existence of terrestrial life in terms of divine activity.</content>

Mercy perfect because of Jesus. mercy is a gift. a gift must be accepted. given to everyone without reguard but not recieved by everyone. an unopened gift is useless.</content>

        <content type='html'>Dear Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;Your suspicion that the doctrine of substitutionary atonement is an error is correct. It is not possible that a resolution between God and men can be obtained by men as the result of the sacrifice of a human male. For the actual outcome of sacrificing any human male results in the requirement of having to give a direct accounting to God, Gen.9:5. But take special note of Gen. 9:5b "and from each man too." &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What the crucifixion of Jesus has perfected, according to God's purpose, is the Way for God to require each man to Repent of the one sin of Jesus' murder in order to be forgiven of all sins. This is the narrow gate to obtain mercy from God. For God loves obedience rather than sacrifice. The law of God was changed but only in regard to Jesus' life being taken by bloodshed. See Rom. 5:20, Heb. 7:12. Repent has been added to the law, but only in regard to the sin of Jesus' crucifixion, so that not repenting of the sin of Jesus' crucifixion is also a sin.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Theodore A. Jones</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have read both your statement regarding God's mercy and justice and the reaponse back from several others, perfectly stating how both God's justice and mercy can be in perfect harmony, along with several examples and references which back their rebuttles. I by no means have the back ground that those before me have,as I find myself more simple minded, but I still would like to add something to this thing.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You have tried to explain this whole "justice and mercy" thing away from a human perspective. Have you ever given God himself a chance to explain it to you? One of the greatest things about our God is that all it takes is faith in Him, and your life drastically changes. He opens doorsm and gives insight to the things we have never experienced befor we placed our faith in Him.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My question to you is, have you given God the chance to explain this to you? Have you ever placed any faith whatsoever into Gods hands and allowed him to take control and lead you to the answers? I say this because, nothing else  matters until you have placed your faith in God. If you cannot win heavenly wars with earthly weapons, how can you honestly belive you can understand God by viewing Him from earthly standards? You have to let go of your earthly ways to truly see and appreciate who God is and what he has offered us.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I know this probably won't make your page and honestly, that does not matter. My whole point here is to turn to God for the answers rather than man, as God obviously can explain it better than we can. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again, I am more simple minded than those you have posted before me, but I encourage you to try letting go for once and ask God to clarify this on His own. You might just find something you have been looking for all along.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Put it in God's hands Stu.Talk with Him. Let your decisions be made based on what God tells you, not man. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God Bless you Stu. I pray this all comes to light for you.</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;However, those who still believe in Hell must view it as a retributive form of justice, as punishment for wrongs - it is in this matter, relating to Hell, that God cannot be both just and merciful.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Not necessarily. Let me propose a simple analogy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I am at a bus station and two busses are about to depart going to different locations and I must choose to buy a ticket and board one of them. Let say, just for fun, that I have heard that one bus driver enforces strict rules on the behavior of the passengers and even denies them some of what they might consider their rights. The other bus driver is known to allow, even encourage, his passenger to do whatever they like. Some even say their is no driver assigned to the bus and the passengers themselves are in control. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I've also heard that the two destinations are quite different. In one, the strict driver is in charge but somehow the place is regarded as quite pleasant. The other destination is known primarily as the place that's not the place where the strict driver rules. It's pictured as torturous by those who have bought tickets the other bus (though they're probably just trying to justify their own choice, right?). Depending on what scenario I'd prefer—the way of restricted freedom or the way of autonomy—I board the most appropriate bus. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;When the bus arrives it turns out that, since I am were I chose to be, it's where I prefer to be. If it's where I am not the king but a subject, I'm happy with that. If it's away from that one who claims to be king over me and I can be my own lord and master, then I'd rather be there.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Do you want to spend eternity with the Christ whom you don't even want to spend, at most, the next 60  years with?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What you want is what you get.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;***&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Divorce-C-S-Lewis/dp/0006280560/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3949919-9185602?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182615767&amp;sr=8-1" REL="nofollow"&gt;The Great Divorce by C.S.

        <title type='text'>Hi everyone thanks for your comments.  All very in...</title>
        <content type='html'>Hi everyone thanks for your comments.  All very insightful and thought-provoking.  However, I still think my argument is right :-)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Firstly, I will throw out a question:  does mercy need a condition?  Is it part of the definition of showing mercy that a condition be attached?  Do you have to ask for mercy in order for mercy to be shown to you?  Who is more merciful, one who shows mercy to all people regardless of whether or not they ask for it, or one who shows mercy only if it is asked for and not before?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Secondly, the issue is being blurred here by talk of different types of justice.  Cori, you said that you would like to believe that God's justice is more restorative than retributive.  This is all very well, and a very nice and admirable picture to have of God.  Very likely the view of God I would have if I believed in one.  However that kind of justice creates issues when talking about a permanent, eternal punishment such as Hell.  How is this restorative?  When does restoration take place?  When is the healing, the forgiveness?  Hell simply does not fit in with this idea of justice, which is why people who hold this view tend to have a more universalist stance and reject the eternal nature of Hell, if they believe in Hell at all.  I totally agree - Hell is a damaging, soul-destroying (literally :-)) anachronism, best to discard it and move on.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, those who still believe in Hell must view it as a retributive form of justice, as punishment for wrongs - it is in this matter, relating to Hell, that God cannot be both just and merciful.  Those who disbelieve in Hell have no problem with God being merciful and just, and neither do I, in that sense.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thirdly, and this is something which I struggle to understand, how exactly is sin against God?  Personally?  How can God be the "victim" (for want of a better word) of me lying to my neighbour, for instance?  Even if we flagrantly transgress God's law, how is the law-maker the victim of the law-breaker?  If parliament creates a law, how in any sense is parliament the victim if the law is broken?  If a football player fouls another player, breaking a rule of football, who is the victim?  The referee?  The Football Association?  Such a claim seems to me utterly incomprehensible, but please feel free to enlighten me on where I'm going wrong.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This is perhaps more confusing because breaking the law and rebellion are used interchangeably by Christians.  I posit that they are different things intirely.  For a person to rebel against someone else, he must consciously realise that he is going against the person and carry on anyway.  I do not think that people who commit crimes are consciously aware, with every crime they commit, that they are personally defying God in each and every crime.  Sure, they may be aware that they are breaking the law of the land, but they are not consciously rebelling against God specifically.  We could also ask the question, is rebellion in itself a crime?  Sometimes it is good to rebel against oppressive regimes, against violent parents.  Rebellion against cultural norms is what creates new breakthroughs in art and science.  It may cause hurt to the person who is being rebelled against, but is that a crime of the person rebelling, or merely a propensity in the person rebelled against to take things too personally?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Fourthly, Sim, I don't understand your analogy of the victim taking the punishment of the crime.  Sure I know what you're getting at, but in what sense does it show either justice or mercy that a rape victim would choose to serve the rapist's sentence?</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You maybe don’t like my analogy, but I used it deliberately because it is the best available. I can perfectly understand your position. Indeed, the analogy you cite is a powerfully emotive one. However, it will not do for the simple reason that it misses the point. Your analogy breaks down because the victim of the crime can have no say in what happens to the perpetrator – presumably the victim is dead. What must be borne in mind when we discuss sin and the justice of God is that all sin, though on one level it may be interpersonal, is ultimately against God. You might dispute this, but think about it. Every sin is an act of rebellion against our Creator, whether wittingly or unwittingly. Such crimes as you have alluded to are a flagrant transgression of God’s Law and are at the least an act of disobedience or an act of outright rebellion. Put this way God moves from being just the judge to being also the “victim” (I don’t know that that is the best word to use but it will have to do). Change your analogy slightly and drop out the murder. A man is found guilty of brutal rape, sentence is passed. The court waits with bated breath. Then … the victim steps forward and offers to serve the sentence. This, then, is a totally different scenario, but is actually a more apt analogy for what is taking place. The problem that I think we appear to be coming up against is in thinking up the worst earthly crimes that we can think of, and then saying ‘is this justice if …?’. No one is denying that earthly crimes demand physical, earthly punishments. A person can be forgiven by God but still have to bear the earthly consequences of their actions. Forgiveness can only come from the one who has been wronged, otherwise the term is meaningless. I quite agree with you that in your analogy justice has not been done. I have no need even to “resist the temptation to relate it to a doctrine I am already comfortable with” – it quite clearly has not been done. However, your analogy is, quite simply, faulty – I hope you can see that.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Moving on. Once again your argument is faulty. It is not in the power of a judge once the verdict has finally been given to show mercy. The most he can do is show clemency, that is, passing a less severe sentence based on the circumstances of the case. That is not mercy. The Bible indicates that when the verdict is finally given at the Great White Throne judgement, that verdict will be unalterable. However, people will be judged “according to their works”, that is, sentences will vary. That however, is beside the point. You say ‘one has to actually show mercy’. Quite. Does He not? “It is of God’s mercies that we are not consumed” – the very fact that you and I are alive today (I assume you still are – let me know if you aren’t) is an evidence of the mercy of God in operation. We have offended God many times. We are under sentence of death. That sentence, however, continues to be deferred. Why? So that we can realise this do something about it while there is still time – “the goodness of God leads you to repentence”. As far as your repeated request for your own definition of “perfectly merciful” is concerned, I agree with the other contributors. For God to be perfectly merciful He must show mercy every single time the conditions are met for Him to show mercy. That He does. Every time. Unreservedly.</content>

        <content type='html'>I'll add my two-cents worth concerning how one defines justice...I'm busy working on my doctorate thesis around reconciliation in Rwanda following the genocide of 1994, and justice forms a major part of any reconciliation paradigm. Justice and reconciliation not being at odd with one another, but very much interrelated.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In the field of conflict resolution we make several distinctions: retributive versus restorative justice, individual versus social justice etc etc. I would like to believe, from what I have discovered in my engaging with God, that his justice falls largely under the 'restorative category.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Jim Consedine (1999) describes how the restorative and retributive paradigms differ: Where retribuitve justice is about punishment, vengeance, exclusion, isolation, destructiveness, retorative justice is about reconciliation, healing, bringing offender and perpetrator back together again, restoration, forgiveness...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Holding a 'restorative justice' view concerning God brings into questions some of the conclusions we draw concerning what the crucifiction actually meant...</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu, I agree pretty much with Tim that you have not defined justice properly. Of the 7 relevant definitions at dictionary.com only one (the 5th) matches your punishment-centric definition. The principle idea behind the word justice is "the quality of being just; righteousness, equitableness, or moral rightness."&lt;BR/&gt;    &lt;BR/&gt;Also, by focusing on punishment you have ignored the "setting to rights" -- as the British call it -- the circumstance of the offended. The is the idea behind the debt analogies. Unless the debt is repayed, punishment of the debtor is not serving justice entirely. In your courtroom illustration you say that if the judge ruled that his son would serve the sentence rather than the perpetrator, the family would not feel justice was served. But in truth, the family cannot have justice under any circumstances because they can not be set right; their daughter is still dead. Deserved punishment and justice are related but not equivalent concepts.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Another principle that applies to this discussion of the covenant (or covenants) between God and Man. With this principle in mind we see that there is a contract between God and Man. God, being God, has set the terms and is bound by them. Man, being Creature, has no choice but to accept the terms and is likewise bound by them. Man has broken the terms and God seeks recourse within the terms of the contract. That contract includes substitutionary atonement in accordance with God's justice and mercy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You have also committed the error of assuming that God's possessing an attribute "perfectly" means he possesses it to an unlimited degree. This is the fallacy behind the "can God make a rock so big he can't lift it" objection we all have heard from 6th grade on regarding God's omnipotence. Omnipotence does not mean that God can do anything. He can't lie. He can't make a round square. He can't act against his own nature. Tim rightly observes that the balance among his attributes is where the perfection lies. The same principle applies to many things in life.</content>

        <content type='html'>Your sleight of hand problem arises from the common error caused by human reason. In God's sight there is only one grade of sin. Granted, the analogy previously used will represent only a partial picture when viewed from the human standpoint, but as far as God is concerned, all humanity are sinners, ungodly, enemies (Romans 5) - engaged in open hostility.&lt;BR/&gt;You continue to misunderstand the idea that God is perfectly merciful. His mercy is extended to all, regardless of who they are. God is prepared to pardon His enemies unconditionally on the basis that the believing sinner surrenders and renounces his sin. However, God's mercy can only be actually appreciated when this has happened.</content>

        <content type='html'>Thanks for your response Sim.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I have to take issue with your debt analogy. You say there is no sleight of hand, but I think this is exactly where the sleight of hand comes in. Punishment for a crime is not equivalent to a debt that needs to be paid. They are completely different things. I think an analogy on my part might help to illustrate my point. A prisoner stands in the dock accused of brutal rape and murder. Imagine yourself as a family member of the victim. You sit in court with bated breath as the judge announces the sentence. The judge issues the severest penalty possible. Justice has been done. How do you feel at this point? The judge makes an announcement: his son has offered to serve the sentence instead of the defendent. The prisoner is free to go; acquitted. Now how do you feel? Imagine the reaction of the court. Has justice been done here? Answer honestly, resist the temptation to relate this to a doctrine you are already comfortable with. The idea of one person bearing the punishment for another's crimes would be incomprehensible if it were not ingrained peoples minds from an early age.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You say "To be merciful in character one need only not want the sentence to be carried out and desire to exercise clemency ... that does not mean that clemency or mercy has to be exercised unconditionally" - I agree. However I disagree totally with your rewording: "for God to be perfectly merciful, it follows that He does not desire that anyone should have to receive the punishment that they deserve." If a judge did not desire that anyone should receive the punishment they deserved, and yet never acted on this desire, never once showed lenience when passing sentences even in the most extenuating of circumstances, could they still be described as merciful? In order to &lt;I&gt;be merciful&lt;/I&gt;, one has to &lt;I&gt;actually show mercy&lt;/I&gt;, not just &lt;I&gt;wish that one could show mercy&lt;/I&gt;. It does follow that to be perfectly merciful, one must show mercy every time. If there were but one instance in which mercy was not shown, one is not perfectly merciful. If you like you can claim that God is merciful &lt;I&gt;sometimes&lt;/I&gt;, or even &lt;I&gt;most of the time&lt;/I&gt;, but please don't claim he is perfectly merciful.</content>

        <title type='text'>Hi Stu. As I said you've tempted me into print. Se...</title>
        <content type='html'>Hi Stu. As I said you've tempted me into print. See what you think of the following.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It strikes me that the apparent contradiction that you have raised is actually self-made and arises: 1. from an inadequate definition of justice at the beginning, and 2. from an assumption that for God to be merciful that mercy must be unconditional.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We will for the moment leave aside the idea of reward in relation to justice, since this in any case would not bring it into conflict with mercy which, as you rightly state, may be defined as being spared the punishment one deserves.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Justice must be defined as follows: to every misdemeanour there is an appropriate penalty. For justice to be satisfied this penalty must be paid in full. In principle the penalty should be met by the perpetrator. It is not considered “justice” for the wrong person to be pursued and convicted. So far so good, and there is no deviation from your definition yet. However, what happens when the perpetrator is not able to meet the demands for justice to be satisfied? This point is best understood in relation to debt. Say a person has run up huge credit card bills that he is unable to pay. Justice says that the person who incurred the debt should repay it. But he is unable to do it. How is justice to be satisfied? To simply write off the debt would not be just – for one thing it wouldn’t be fair to all those who pay their credit card bills in full every month. Another option, which could be considered an appropriate punishment, would be to throw the debtor into the debtor’s prison (an option which happened in the days of Mr Micawber!). However, if in prison, evidently there would never be any way in which he could personally pay off his debt and he would have to remain there indefinitely. There is, however, a third option and that is for a third party who is both willing and able to pay the debt in full and satisfy the creditor. For “justice” to be satisfied in the case of debt all that matters is that the debt is paid completely not who pays it. Herein lies an important qualification to your definition of justice. Moreover it is a principle that is widely used – how often have parents bailed out their children?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;To say that God is merciful, or even that a person is merciful is not the same thing as saying that mercy must be unconditional. To be merciful in character one need only not want the sentence to be carried out and desire to exercise clemency. Verses from the Bible such as those that say that God does not will the death of any, or that He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked illustrate this point. However, that does not mean that clemency or mercy has to be exercised unconditionally. In the case of a God whose attributes are in perfect balance, for example, mercy will not be exercised at the expense of justice.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I return then to your question. How can God be perfectly just and perfectly merciful, or rather, what does it mean for God to be perfectly just and perfectly merciful? On the basis of what we have seen, we may reword what you have said as follows: “For God to be perfectly just in regard to humanity, it must follow that” every sin must be paid for in full. “Likewise, for God to be perfectly merciful, it follows that” He does not desire that anyone should have to receive the punishment that they deserve.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And here we have not a contradiction but a dilemma. How can God be perfectly just and yet exercise mercy? How can justice be satisfied, yet God pardon the guilty? How can sin be paid for without the sinner paying for it? This is where my qualification of your definition of justice comes in. This is by no means a sleight of hand, as you put it, nor is it distracting from the central point, nor is it an aside. The only way that the debt can be cancelled is for someone else who is both willing and able to pay it. The only one who actually fits both these categories is God Himself. Therefore, for God to exercise mercy he must himself satisfy the claims of justice. Paul elaborates on the whole principle in the second half of Romans 3 (if you want me to explain it to you I will separately). In Christ the matter is perfectly resolved. Justice is not a quality shown to a particular person it is an appropriate measure taken in relation to a misdemeanour. To take your example of a repentant sinner he has undoubtedly been shown mercy – the punishment he deserves has been withheld from him. Has justice been satisfied? Yes, because the debt was paid in full by Christ. How is that justice? Because one who was actually able to pay off the debt was also willing to do it and did it.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This leaves a final point to be made (for now). Why then, if there is a just basis for showing mercy, does God not just pardon everybody? I return to the point I made earlier. Mercy is not unconditional, but the exercise of mercy is determined by our response to the provision that God has made. To illustrate this from the picture I’ve been consistently using, if a debtor receives a cheque for the full amount of his debt but does nothing with it the provision of his benefactor avails nothing. If to be merciful is to desire to exercise clemency and that desire causes one to make provision to be able to do it, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the acceptance of that provision is a necessary condition that must be met.</content>

        <content type='html'>You argue that there are two avenues open to us where either justice or mercy is discarded. But the Bible presents a different approach where both justice and mercy are upheld absolutely. God cannot in any way bend His character to accommodate us. I’m glad about that because my salvation depends on God getting things right so that He cannot at any time, now or in the future be accused of “foul play” and therefore my salvation be called into question.&lt;BR/&gt;God’s mercy cannot be exercised at the expense of His justice or holiness. God’s justice (upholding a right standard) must be satisfied without compromise in respect of every single person.&lt;BR/&gt;The Bible shows how that God loves (John 3 v 16), He warns (Amos 4 v 12), He commands (Acts 17 v 30/31). He does not desire that any single person should perish (2 Peter 3 v 9). &lt;BR/&gt;The Bible also states that the soul that sinneth it shall die (Ezekiel 18 v 20) and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6 v 23).&lt;BR/&gt;To argue that God does not have perfect justice and mercy is to misunderstand and even to undermine the meaning of the cross. Without the cross, justice and mercy will never be reconciled and there would be no gospel message. The need of every single person is met here.&lt;BR/&gt;There is a lovely hymn that expresses this perfectly: -&lt;BR/&gt;1 THE perfect righteousness of God, Is witnessed in the Saviour's blood; 'Tis in the cross of Christ we trace His righteousness, yet wondrous grace&lt;BR/&gt;2 God could not pass the sinner by, Justice demands that he should die; But in the cross of Christ we see How God can save, yet righteous be.&lt;BR/&gt;3 The judgment fell on Jesus' head, 'Twas in His blood sin's debt was paid; Stern Justice can demand no more, And Mercy can dispense her store.&lt;BR/&gt;4 The sinner who believes is free, Can say, "The Saviour died for me:" Can point to the atoning blood, And say, "This made my peace with God."&lt;BR/&gt;There is a depth to the sufferings on the cross by the Saviour that only those who find themselves in hell will be able to understand. But then it will be too late.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Without forcing the issue, Peter preaches that we must be saved. This is God’s desire and His salvation is available. The whole matter now lies with us – do we want it?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God’s mercy is shown to every person accepting His way of salvation. But what of His justice? This has been totally satisfied by the death of the Saviour in our place. It can ask no more of us. After all, if the wages of sin is death, a life has been given so that the matter is settled. God cannot be accused of a sleight of hand in what took place at the cross. We have a volunteer in the person of the Lord Jesus to undertake our cause.&lt;BR/&gt;Take the example of you and me going to a shop. You mention to me in passing that you have need of a certain item but that you cannot afford to pay for it. At which point I pick up the item and take it to the checkout. As we leave the shop, I hand it to you saying “It’s yours, take it”. Would you then have concern that you would be stopped leaving the shop? Was the price demanded not settled in full, so the shop had no further claim on that item? Did you deserve the item? Would you not wholly rest on the fact that I had given it to you, cost settled? Doubtless this would result in you being grateful to me for stepping in to help.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Does this help?</content>

        <title type='text'>Hey Stu, I don't normally get involved with apolog...</title>
        <content type='html'>Hey Stu, I don't normally get involved with apologetics because I'm not a big fan of that whole image of Christians being know-it-all busybodies. But I thought I'd share my thoughts with you on this one, in case it helps.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Firstly, I think that substitutionary atonement, as you put it, does make sense (obviously I do!). The idea of punishing someone/thing else for your sins goes way back into the Old Testament before Jesus. God accepted sacrifices of animals as sin offerings in place of punishing the person. This comes out of love. God places quite a high value on animals because he created them to take pleasure in them and he looks after them. But he cares about human beings more as they are made in his image and the essential feeling he has towards us is love, because he made us to love us. In this sense, then, God is being just, because he is accepting something which is of value to both him and the sinful person as recompense.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If you don't see the justice in this, you might think of the legal system in this country. Many offences can be sentenced with a fine. This is the giving up of something of worth to the higher authority in recompense. It doesn't necessarily match exactly to whatever the offence might have been (it's not logical that a fine is a just exchange for having commited a speeding offence, because the 2 things don't balance each other out in any way). Yet we still call this justice. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God accepted the sacrifice of Jesus because he is of infinite worth both to God himself, and to human beings. When a person becomes a Chrisitian, they agree to give themselves over to Christ. Jesus' sacrifice can repay an infinite amount of sin because he is of infinite worth to God. Even though no-one is claiming not to have struggled with this fact (myself included), the fact is that God asks for somthing (our lives) in exchange for the sin we have done. If we choose to sacrifice our lives to Christ, he in turn will make a sacrifice of his life to make up for the sin that we have done. But if we don't give ourselves to Christ, he won't present that sacrifice before the Father for us because he asks for sacrifice of our lives before he will give his for us (I think this seems pretty just - although his life is worth a whole lot more than mine so really it seems I get the better end of the deal!). Anyway, I know you know all this, I'm just trying to put it in a different way that maybe answers the difficulties you have with this stuff. As for perfect mercy, God has mercy on people who ask him for it. Which also seems pretty fair. You have to say to someone "Have mercy" before they will agree to it.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But anyway, if all my ramblings leave you as convinced as ever that it makes no eartly sense, you're probably right. In 1 Corinthians 1:18, it says "the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate'". God's not particularly fussed if things don't fit our logic. What he wants us to accept is that he is bigger than us. If he says he's perfect, he is, because he came first. If he says that it is perfectly just and perfectly merciful to accept the sacrifice of his Son, then it is. So if we can't understand that, it's because we've got our ideas of "perfection" or "justice" or "mercy" wrong. All of those concepts are defined by and in God. The answer that very many people come up with is, in essence "if that's God's idea of justice, then I want no part with him". But to say that is to fail to look beyond ourselves and realise that any truth must be inherent in God. He just wants us to surrender to him and say that he is right (because he must be - he is God) even though it makes no sense to us. When you talk about the contradictions inherent in Christianity, you are 100% right from a human perspective. The Bible is full of what, in human terms, are logical fallacies - hate your mother and father, but love them as yourself, for example. They only make sense when we relinquish power and just agree to accept that God is right. Then he starts to show us how it all makes sense. Hun, you say that you never experienced the reality of Christianity in your life. The hard thing about it all is - we can't experience that reality until we give our lives up (relinquishing the right to ever take them back). God's spent millions of years proving he exists through all sorts of ways and he knows they don't work because human logic or science will always find a way to explain him out of the equation. Jesus talks about the rich man in hell, to whom it was said "even if someone is raised from the dead you won't believe". That's a pretty powerful sign, but God just knows that people aren't convinced by it. If it would work, God would come and show miraculous signs all over the place and people would believe. But when Jesus did that, loads of people found ways to explain it out of the equation. The only alternative we have as humans who won't accept any proof as final is to take a deep breath, accept that God must necessarily be right, and go for it. Total surrender never fails to work, trust me! You just first have to accept that there's someone to surrender to... I accepted it not because God showed me a single miracle or extraordinary circumstance, but because I saw people from the other side of the point of no return and they clearly had what I didn't! There are also lots of people who claim to be Christians and haven't ever surrendered - and they don't have what I want. So anyway, I went for it and it worked. That's rebirth defined, crossing over the point of no return and clinging to the fact that a God who put you together must have it right, however difficult his truth is to accept.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Emma :)</content>

        <content type='html'>Miracles were an anathema to the Jews as was the idea of a living physical God, either animate or inanimate. The whole idea is not Jewish. Neither was the concept of Christ Jewish, it was Hindoo. The idea was brought back to Israel c 38 CE by Apollonius of Tyana and it is he who tried to sell it to the Jews. They wouldn&amp;#39;t buy it so he took it to the Romans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Romans under the influence of the Piso family had an idea on how to subvert the religion of the Messianic Jewish Movement which was the fastest growing religion in the Empire at that time. A plot was created called the &amp;#39;Pisonian Conspiracy&amp;#39;. The plot called for the assassination of the the Emperor Nero and the creaton of a new religion to compete with the Messianic Jewish one. It failed and 50 Romans met their maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollonius had brought back some religious documents from India which formed the basis for the new scriptures. Quite revealing are the more secular mentions of Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth. First, we have the infamous &amp;#39;Testimonium Flavianum&amp;#39; of Josephus made at the end of &amp;#39;Jewish Antiquities,&amp;#39; which was not published until the middle of the 90s, then we have the quotes by St. Ignatius of Antioch and Clement of Rome also made at the end of the first century and the beginning of the second century. At that time, we also have the famous apologetics quotes by Suetonius and Tacitus about Jesus and the Christiani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, we have the Pauline Epistles which were written and preached during the 50s making no reference to Jesus of Nazareth. The author knows about a cosmic Christ the Savior, but nothing about a real live crucified Jesus Christ. Then we have &amp;#39;The Shepherd of Hermes&amp;#39; which most scholars have attributed to the early second century, but others believe may have been written by &amp;#39;Paul.&amp;#39; Paul was actually Apollonius of Tyana, who was of Greek ancestry, which makes him an obvous candidate to be the author. This scripture was a part of the early Church canon and makes no mention of Jesus of Nazareth. Then we have &amp;#39;The Epistle of Barnabas&amp;#39; believed to have been written during the 80s. This early Church scripture only mentions Jesus Christ, but knows nothing about a real live flesh and blood Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gospel accounts of the life and passion of Jesus Christ are believed to have been first written during the late 60s and early 70s. Strangely, prior to this time no one ever heard of Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth. It was only after the gospels were written that we hear quotes about Jesus Christ. If Jesus Christ were a real person who was crucified c 30 CE we would not need gospels to tell us that he existed and that these events actually happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Scroll archivist Joseph Atwill in &amp;#39;Caesar&amp;#39;s Messiah&amp;#39; clearly shows in the empty tomb narrative, which appears in all 4 gospels, that the gospels had a common source and were not eye witness accounts of some quasi-literate Jewish Apostles. Starting with John, then Matthew, then Mark and finally Luke, what we find is that in Matthew, Mary sees the tomb scene precisely as she left it in John and so on. This shows common knowledge among the authors of all 4 gospels.

        <content type='html'>Hey Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I can understand why you might say that resurrection is a theological explanation and not a historical one, but remember, the resurrection doctrine claims to be embedded in history and therefore if true, is in fact a historical explanation with theological implications.  The question is, using the canons of historical methodology, what evidence is there to infer resurrection over any other alternative.</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I read the same debate but (surprise, surprise!) I came away with quite a different impression. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There is a very significant literature regarding the Apollonius parallel, which goes back a very long way. Craig missed a glorious opportunity to do a slam dunk there. But that's the nature of a public debate; things get dropped.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You write:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;the gospels are not eyewitness accounts, but records of existing oral tradition, the reliability of which is dubious.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'd be interested to know what you think of Richard Bauckham's new book &lt;I&gt;Jesus and the Eyewitnesses&lt;/I&gt;. Bauckham makes a serious case that the authors of the gospels were either eyewitnesses or else had direct access to eyewitnesses (e.g. Luke to the 70 and some of the women). &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again, you write:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;Secondly, that resurrection is a theological explanation, not a historical one. . . . this is not something that history can make any sort of judgement about.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Why not?</content>

        <content type='html'>If you read 1 Corinthians 15, Luke had a lot of people to ask - the greater part of 500 eye witnesses to the fact that the Lord had risen bodily.&lt;BR/&gt;With regard to John, you only have to read the gospel carefully to see that he writes as a frontline witness. cf. 1 v 14 - we beheld His glory.

        <content type='html'>Whether or not someone is a 'reputable historian' does not eliminate them from any bias. Nor does it guarantee skepticism with regard to testimonies. As you say, Luke did not himself see the empty tomb or the risen Jesus. He had to rely on others who claimed to have seen such things. Now if you were Luke, and people claimed that Jesus had risen from the dead, would you disbelieve them? Would you ask them to show you the tomb? Would you try to find the guards who had seen the event and persuade them to tell their story? Or would you just write it down as fact? After all, the purpose of writing your gospel is so that people might believe.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Mark is understood to have got his information from Peter. Understood by whom? Where does Mark say "I got this from Peter"? Is it not merely an oral tradition that this is the case?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Also whether the writers of Matthew or John were actually Matthew and John is very much in doubt by Biblical scholars.</content>

        <title type='text'>The historical evidence for the resurrection of th...</title>
        <content type='html'>The historical evidence for the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is the empty tomb with the obviously empty grave clothes.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It appears from Matthew 27 v 63 that the chief priests had listened to the words of the Lord and remembered His prediction that He would rise again. As a result, they did all that they could to make the tomb safe. However they understood only too well the significance of the report given by the guards in Matthew 28 v 11 and fabricated the explanation that His disciples had stolen the body. Incidentally, although they put around this story, at no point did they confront the disciples with this allegation!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The Lord appeared only to His followers after His resurrection and the list of witnesses is recorded in 1 Corinthians 15. The last view that this unbelieving world had of Jesus was hanging in shame on the cross. The next time He is seen, it will be when He comes in power and glory.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The New Testament attests the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus as a matter of fact and not as an argument or theological explanation. Granted, there are many issues that arise from this fact of resurrection which are dealt with in the epistles. Furthermore, believers expect His literal return to the air to catch them away. For Him to return from heaven logically presupposes that He is already in heaven.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The stark evidence is similar to that presented when Peter was released from prison as recorded in Acts 12. The prison was found empty with guards still in place who were subsequently executed for their incompetence. Peter appears to his acquaintances only, who have difficulty believing that he was free, and was not seen again until much later.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Just because the Lord was not seen by the unbelieving masses, that is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the Biblical record of the resurrection. Matthew was a disciple so was John. John entered the empty tomb and later saw his risen Lord. Luke was a reputable historian of the time who, while not being a disciple, had access to those who had witnessed first hand. Mark is understood to have got his information from Peter who was a disciple at the tomb. I should be very careful therefore regarding your assertions of mere oral tradition and not eyewitness accounts as they are patently not true!</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;So why the need to create some mysterious law of the universe, when there are plenty of reasons for acting morally?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are plenty of reasons to act morally but none of them are ultimately coherent with a materialistic worldview.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;do you obey the moral code just to avoid death...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;First let me clarify my previous comments. The consequences of breaking the moral law are "hardwired" to the act; that was the intended point of my first comment.  Add to that the severity of those consequences, and you've got a pretty compelling reason for keeping the moral law; which was the intended point of my second comment. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;To answer your question: I can't obey the moral code sufficiently well to avoid death. It's at this point that Christianity parts company with other religions (and even from the way Christianity itself is popularly understood).</content>

        <content type='html'>&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Naturalist:&lt;/B&gt; Why should we obey the moral code?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;B&gt;Theist:&lt;/B&gt; Because the moral code (law) is as much a law of the universe as are the laws of physics. If you ignore (disobey) the laws of physics by, say, jumping out a window on the 10th floor, you will pay inevitable consequences. Your death would not be punishment but simply the result of your actions.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You should obey the moral laws because you (both body and soul) will die if you don't.</content>

        <content type='html'>Taking your last two posts on morality together, am I to understand then that morality is based on knowledge? &lt;BR/&gt;Who teaches a child to do wrong things and to know that he/she has done wrong without being told? Evolution and natural philosophy cannot explain this. We are shut up totally to the enlightenment of the Bible to explain that we have a conscience placed within us by God as part of our make up for this very purpose (see Rom 2).&lt;BR/&gt;The Bible teaches that law merely hammers home the verdict already given by the conscience – guilty; and the law then provides a mechanism for a sentence to be passed.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You ask why we should do right. This surely solely depends on your worldview, &lt;BR/&gt;e.g.: -&lt;BR/&gt;1) There is no God: I can do what I want and what I see is right for me. I can break laws with impunity. If I do get caught, this will be an inconvenience only (see Luke 17 v 27). I have no responsibility to society at large.&lt;BR/&gt;2) There is a God: then I am answerable to Him as my Creator. My view on life will permanently be influenced by what He thinks of me (Heb 10 v 31). Records are being kept (Rev 20 v 12).&lt;BR/&gt;Without a worldview that includes God, society will inevitably fall apart. Life has no meaning apart from self assertion.</content>

        <content type='html'>Actually it's not so difficult when I stay focused on your question and  not where you might be leading.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;I&gt;...so who decides who gets what inclinations...is it his fault...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As far as culpability is concerned what difference does it make? If two people are on trial for murder, who will get the harsher sentence, the one for whom the act was an aberrant crime of passion, or the one for whom the act was in keeping with their murderous inclinations? Most juries and judges (outside California) will rightly punish the latter more harshly. People are (not "should be" but "are") held accountable for behavior that springs from their will regardless of how corrupted it is or who corrupted it.</content>

        <content type='html'>Before we leave your original question let me ask you something; can I restate it as follows without losing your intention? &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Is the person who must struggle to be good more moral than the person who does not?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If so, then is the person who must struggle to pass a calculus exam more intelligent that the person who does not?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think any person who struggles to achieve something—even bad things like becoming the city's leading drug-dealer—is exhibiting admirable qualities like perseverance, industriousness, and hope. The calculus student who has trouble with the concepts but studies hard to grasp them is exhibiting admirable traits, but he would never be considered &lt;I&gt;more&lt;/I&gt; intelligent (re: calculus) than the girl who does equally well without cracking the book or even paying attention in class. She would be called a genius. He would be called conscientious.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your new questions regarding inclinations are good, but difficult, ones. I am working on a response that I hope to post very soon. It may not be worth the wait, but I'd like to hear what you think.</content>

        <title type='text'>After having gone back and read some of the other ...</title>
        <content type='html'>After having gone back and read some of the other posts, I apologize for mentioning what you've already considered - that not knowing the answer to this question does not preclude the existence of God.  As you mention, considering this point in a vaccuum wouldn't help you answer the bigger question. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Since that is the case, I suggest that you might more profitably concentrate on the other arguments for and against the existence of God, &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm sure you've already spent some time doing this. I'm suggesting you are better off setting aside this particular issue for the moment until (one may hope) you have a context to consider it in. Please notice I'm not implying it isn't a very important question.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Because honestly, that is the approach I am able to take with this and other questions.  I care very much about the answers.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I actively and agressively search for answers, but do it within a framework of belief built on information I think I do have, and where I may reasonably suppose that there are things I don't understand at this moment.  I use this approach in everyday life, and it doesn't seem irregular to me. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again, www.reasonablefaith.org is in my opinion a good place to start.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Jeff</content>

        <content type='html'>First, may I suggest checking out William Lane Craig's Reasonable Faith site, if you haven't already done so?  You could also pose your question to him - there is a link on the Q&amp;A page for that purpose. I hope you may find something helpful and relevant there. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I don't know why God allows evil (like many people I speculate), and I certainly do care about the answer. I truly do believe in God nonetheless, and believe that he is good. I can certainly understand why somebody without a belief in God and his goodness would find this a high hurdle to get over.  I'm glad you have the desire to try.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If you suppose for a moment that you had proof, of whatever sort that would satisfy you, that God (the being who created the universe), really exists - would you really expect to understand all of His actions, reasoning, moral standard etc., except as he communicated these things to you? And wouldn't there reasonably be limits to what we could understand?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Obviously, I'm not just talking about somebody really smart and powerful here.  I'm talking about a being who essentially defies description. I guess my point is - if we don't know the answer, how could we reasonably suppose there is none?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;At the same time, I believe he has communicated a fair amount - my belief is that my own sense of right and wrong, compassion, everything good thing, came from that being.  I don't think I believe these things just because it is convenient to do so, but I understand it would be hard for me to convince you of that.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Logic is a part of the reason I believe in God, but I don't discount my own personal experience either.  I figure God didn't make exceptional intelligence a prerequisite for belief.  Lots of people would get written off it that were the case.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I do think that sincerity is a requirement.  A truly sincere desire to find out the truth, using &lt;I&gt;everything&lt;/I&gt; you've learned and experienced in your time here. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Jeff</content>

        <content type='html'>The Christian has no more of an answer to where good comes from as does the atheist.  Sure, the Christian has the stock reply that "good comes from God" - but what does this mean?  That good is defined by what God just happens to prefer, or does God prefer what's good because it is good in itself? In the first case, we have an explanation for where good comes from, but it has no value - good is just what we call the things the most powerful being in the universe likes.  But since when did might make right?  What if the most powerful being liked rape and murder?  Would those be good then?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Alternatively, if God prefers what's good because it's good in itself, then we still have no answer to the origin of good.  Why are the things good that God prefers?  You see the question is not answered, only deferred.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The reason I "harp on" about the origin of evil is that it seems to me to be something that Christianity is particularly unable to explain.  OK, the existence of evil isn't going to disprove Christianity outright - when it comes to the crunch Christians can always fall back on the "there may be a reason for it we don't understand" argument.  However, for someone who doesn't already believe in God, what's more likely, that this world with all its suffering and misery was created by an all-powerful, all-loving God who hates evil but allows it to happen for some reason which we don't understand, or that there is no such God?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The part of the book I was referring to was pages 29 and 30, which compares Sept 11th to the tower falling in Jerusalem.</content>

        <content type='html'>By the way I have a copy of the book you refer to. It's basic conclusion is that we don't really know why God allows these things to happen, but "unless you repent, you too will perish"!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one whom this strikes as being deliciously lame.</content>

        <title type='text'>The question is not why God allows evil to exist. ...</title>
        <content type='html'>The question is not why God allows evil to exist.  That is only a question you can ask once you already believe God exists.  Once you make that assumption, you can then try to come up with reasons why God would allow evil, however implausible they sound.  Or if you like, you can simply say we don't know the reason.  It doesn't matter, because you've already decided God does exist despite what other people may see as evidence to the contrary.   God exists.  Therefore if evil exists there must be a reason for it, even if we don't know what it is.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It is to the person who hasn't already decided whether God exists that evil is a problem.  Does God exist or doesn't he? How can we know?  Well, let's start from one thing we know does exist: evil.  Now, is the fact that evil exists more compatible with the idea that God exists, or that he doesn't?  To someone who doesn't already believe in the existence of God, evil fits much better with the idea that God doesn't exist.  The idea of God poses more questions than it answers, &lt;I&gt;with regard to the problem of evil&lt;/I&gt; - i.e. God is supposed to be all-good and all-powerful, how does this explain the presence of evil?  It doesn't.  More explanations are now needed to explain why an all-good and all-powerful God could allow evil to happen.  Most of these explanations are unconvincing to an unbeliever - they lack the explanatory force necessary to do justice to the problem.  Many apologists admit this, and simply retreat into the position that there must be a reason, we just don't know what it is.  As I said, this is fine for the believer, who feels he doesn't have to worry about it.  But it is no help to the non-believer, as it simply indicates that the God hypothesis does nothing further to explain the existence of evil. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Therefore the non-believer who is searching for truth must disregard the God hypothesis with regard to the existence of evil, at least until such time as a better attempt is made to reconcile the two.  However, given past history, he/she is probably justified in thinking that this is unlikely.</content>

        <content type='html'>You ask the question again as to why God allowed evil to exist. Do we need to know the answer to this? The fact undisputedly is that it does. It reminds me of those that say “Seeing is Believing” and they refuse to move on from there. Like the Scribes and Pharisees that demanded a sign to enable them to believe. What God wants us to know has been given to us in the Bible. Are you saying then, that if the answer to your question is not provided, that God ceases to be God? That would surely be absurd.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Moving on to the question of why God does not act, you point to The Tale of the Twelve Officers, the logic of which I find intriguing. A clever argument, but I feel that it misrepresents God (1 Corinthians 1 v 21 “…the world by wisdom knew not God…”). The position has been covered very well by John Blanchard in his book “Where was God on September 11?). If you want a copy then please let me know.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God directly intervened in the past and left a record of what happened. The Bible makes it very clear that God will directly intervene in the future. However, it seems that in this present age, direct intervention has been put on hold since He spoke finally in His Son (Hebrews 1), but men rejected God’s answer and said “We will not have this Man….” and crucified Him. That is not to say that God cannot intervene. He does sometimes in ways that defy the ability of men to explain. The Christian though has direct representation at the throne of heaven in the person of the Lord Jesus Himself.</content>

Of course Divine assistence is always better than just the rational approach. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, we live in a world where many do not want to take God into their lives in a direct way or - head on. Many try to find the order of things in a philosophical way in the study of being as being.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Even thought this only leads us up to the door of Faith. We must then knock and God opens us to the Divine - It is supernatural.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, moral objectivity should not be limited to this alone. All men should seek moral objectivity of what is right and what is wrong beyond human opinion. It is actually a pragmatic thing to do since the biblical saying - do unto others as you would have them do to you - is a very practical exercise too. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, there is no reason for seeking truth if it is considered just a subjective pursuit. This makes no sense. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think we all have met someone in our lives who seemed to be inherently naturally good. These are the people that make us wonder about what is possible outside the supernatural Divive help of God.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I explore philosophy and religion for another reason since human dignity in the workday is under assault in the global economic arena. I also explore it because an old study haunts me. This old study never seems to change. It reported that 70 percent of all church goers are unable to bring their Saturday or Sunday worship spirit to the workweek.&lt;BR/&gt; &lt;BR/&gt;See http://www.therationale.com&lt;BR/&gt;( There is a healing prayer there for those who are seeking the second touch of the Lord .)</content>

        <content type='html'>Jon, I think you're misunderstanding me. Granted, 1) if God exists, 2) he has revealed himself to humans, and 3) the Bible is an accurate record of this revelation, then sure, God is like the Bible says he is. Now of course you and all Christians are free to presuppose these things. I myself can't do that.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That's beside the point however. My question is, regardless of what God is actually like, why is he this way? Does the definition of a God entail that he hate the suffering of the innocent, or is it logically possible that a God could exist which did not hate this?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My question about possible worlds was not "Is there another universe out there that exists now in which God is evil", but is there a possible world in which God is evil as opposed to (let's assume for the sake of argument) the current one in which he is good?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;A possible world is merely a logical construct to describe a collection of statements to which truth values have been assigned. For instance, possible world A contains the statements "Jim likes beans" and "Jim is married", and possible world B contains the statement "Jim likes beans" and "Jim is a bachelor". Both worlds are logically possible, i.e. there is no inherent contradiction in Jim's liking for beans and his married state. However, there is no possible world in which the statements "Jim is married" and "Jim is a bachelor" both hold. This is because there is an inherent contradiction between the two statements, and it is impossible for that world to be the true one.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now let's use this method to talk about God. Possible world A contains the statements "God exists" and "God hates the suffering of the innocent". Possible world B contains the statements "God exists" and "God loves the suffering of the innocent". Now regardless of which world is the true one, if any (another possible world contains the statement "God does not exist"), is there anything inherently contradictory about the statements in possible world B?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If so, then God is necessarily good, and thus good is a logically preexisting concept by which God is defined.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, if there is nothing inherently contradictory about possible world B, then God can be said to define good and evil. But the point here is that good and evil are now totally arbitrary, and if possible world B was in fact true, then the suffering of the innocent would be good.</content>

        <title type='text'>I am saying, Stu, that if you start from the point...</title>
        <content type='html'>I am saying, Stu, that if you start from the point of trying to understand the Christian God, the one revealed in Jesus and communicated in the Bible, you must either accept that when God says "Is there any God besides me? No..." (eg Isiah 44:8 and others) we either take it at face value or we can accept nothing that God says about Himself and nothing that is recorded in the Bible. To do that is to decide that all of Christianity is flawed, un-trustable and not worthy of this discussion.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Our knowledge of other qualities of God depend on Him being trustable. In terms of us knowing God and finding out about Him, we must have some seed of faith, else we can trust nothing that is said and nothing can convince us otherwise. We are bound to run into illogicalities if we try to investigate a God whose own words we cannot accept as truth, let alone the assertions of his followers. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The necessity is in the terms of our investigation: if we're looking at Christianity we must accept that the Christian view is that God's description of Himself in the Bible is true, in fact that the description of God by people in the Bible is true (unless it is obvious from context that they are wrong or do not in fact trust God themselves). To do otherwise is to to presuppose that Christianity is wrong. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm sure you will say that this leaves nothing to philosophize over:  possibly not - the Bible does not question whether God exists or whether He is good; it takes it as a starting point. We can go from there to think about whether morality is objective, or whether the constructs 2000 years of church have built on top of scripture are consistent. Those are questions we can definitely tackle.</content>

        <content type='html'>Hmm.  Jon, I'm intrigued by the phrase "If God is actually God in any meaningful way there can be no other God".  What do you mean when you say "there can be no other God"?  Are you saying that God must &lt;I&gt;of necessity&lt;/I&gt; have the particular attributes you ascribe to him?  This is exactly the same as saying that God's nature is necessary.  In what sense, other than a logical one, could that phrase have any meaning?  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;"There can be no other God."  Why not?  Just because you say so?  Just because that's the type of God that appeals to you?  Or because there's a deeper underlying &lt;I&gt;logical&lt;/I&gt; reason why this is so?  Something along the lines of "If God exists, he must be X, Y and Z, as these are entailed by the definition of God.  If God were not X, Y and Z, he would not be God"?  This is a logical argument.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There is circular reasoning going on here.  You are on the one hand arguing that God &lt;I&gt;necessarily&lt;/I&gt; has the attributes he does, i.e. it is &lt;I&gt;logically impossible&lt;/I&gt; for God to be other than you define, and in the same breath you are saying that God created logic, or that logic is dependent on God in some way.</content>

        <content type='html'>One fact cannot be denied by the apologists: not 'sinning' is selfish. christianity is cloaked in altruism but every 'good' act or infidel converted brings the christian closer to their personal reward. That's the bottom line. 'Accept Jesus and go to heaven.' 'Feed the poor and go to heaven.' &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I believe that morality is relative but it is in our species best interest to generally get along.</content>

        <content type='html'>The assumption that there is a god is the initial fallacy.  An imaginary friend is still imaginary no matter how comforting his "presence" may be.  There is no evidence for the existence of god, or for his continued interest in us.  So-called "holy" texts are all internally inconsistent and sanction some pretty horrible behaviour.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Let's face it, if the biblical god is so damn insecure that he needed human sacrifice, dictated diets, and  essentially said,"Do what I say, or else", then he isn't god, just a different life-form in need of psychiatric counselling.  To think that such a creature is held up as the arbiter of right and wrong is laughable, if it wasn't so damn tragic.</content>

        <content type='html'>Is it logical to discuss a universe where there is another "supreme being"? If God is actually God in any meaningful way there can be no other God. If there can be no other God than ours, surely it is illogical to use logic to try to imagine a universe with a different type of God?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And that is only if we accept that logic can be extended out of its created habitat, our universe. If God created logic, its scope is limited to the boundaries of creation. That is not to say it has no place in understanding Gods interactions with humans - God often chooses to be bound by His creation, as supremely evidenced by Jesus. It does mean that we must recognise that there are logical oppositions in the very fact of Gods "otherness" and different character to the universe we know. For example, the classic poser of whether God can create the rock that is too heavy for Him to lift, as I mentioned before.</content>

        <content type='html'>So let's get this straight Jon, you are saying that morality is not objective but in some way contingent on the nature of God?  So that what is good and what is evil are defined by the nature of God and not by some pre-existing (in a logical sense) definition of morality?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But then we come to the question of whether the moral nature of God is contingent or necessary.  Is it logically possible for the moral nature of God to be such that the unnecessary suffering of the innocent would be defined as good?  If the moral nature of God is contingent, then there would be a possible (logical) world in which God delighted in suffering and in which our aim would be to help God in maximising suffering in the world.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If this is so, then why does God have the particular moral nature that he has?  We cannot say that the moral nature of God &lt;I&gt;has&lt;/I&gt; to be the way it is, because the premise is that his moral nature is contingent.  The conclusion must be that good and evil are arbitrary, in the sense that had we wound with a God with a different nature, they would have different definitions.  Don't you see that this is in fact the same as moral relativism, albeit at a logical level rather than a cultural one.  The only reason we should try to do good is not for its own sake (this is meaningless if good and evil are arbitrary), but because those actions merit the approval of the particular God we happened to wind up under.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now I suspect that you won't like that conclusion, so let's look at the other line of argument: God's moral nature is not in fact contingent, but necessary.  God does not desire the unnecessary suffering of the innocent because God is perfect, and a perfect being must not desire the unnecessary suffering of the innocent.  Why? Because to desire the unnecessary suffering of the innocent is &lt;I&gt;evil&lt;/I&gt;, and a perfect being cannot be evil.  Thus perfection is already defined in terms of good and evil, and God, rather than defining good, &lt;I&gt;is defined by it&lt;/I&gt;, in the sense that if he were not good, he would not be God.</content>

        <content type='html'>I think that objectivity and subjectivity get us tied up in knots when we try to use them in reference to God. God is (by definition) bigger and greater that this universe. The use of God as a subject in a discussion about morality is almost nonsensical and leads to absurd situations, for example, proving that wrong-doing (or "sins") do not exist.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Let us consider that morality is totally subjective; i.e. morality is different from different subjective viewpoints, dependent on the culture, location and conditioning of the subject. Hence, what is morally right/wrong/ambiguous would be different for me and for you. Or, for example different for me and for God as another subjective observer. If God and I have different moral codes because of our different experiences, it would be illogical to think breaking His Law could be taken as an offense that breaks relationship with Him.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, to say that God cannot control what is right and wrong is like saying that God cannot control what is light or dark: God defines good, God defines Light. It is part of his being, it is part of the way he is represented in our Universe. To suggest He cannot control (or "decide it" it is to suggest He is unable to change His unchanging being.

        <content type='html'>2 timothy 2:15 tells us to study and rightly divide the work of truth. 2 timothy 3:16 tells us that all scripture is given for our learning. I wish i had the original to translate this story from because it would probably clear up a lot that is lost in the indefinate english language. whether the daughter was sacrificed (against the biblical laws)or set aside??? but I guess that we can learn that all He had to do was ask God to help him, not bargain with God. And the importance of promises made to God and in this case foolishly and sinfully. You asked why God didn't send something else out first because he could have yes. but perhaps God wanted US to learn a lesson from the story. (your Feb 26 2007 comment) and wanted him to learn the lesson as well.or to see if Jephtah really meant what he said. after all it would be easy to sacrifice a chicken it that was the first thing out the door. or as a punishment for the sinful act of bargaining ( in the long run a whole lot more painful to him than his daughter as he would have to live with his decision ) however, being the "sacrifice" seems to be deemed acceptable to God and we know this because he remained the judge of Isreal for a number of years later and not immediately taken down, that she was probably set aside. I hope you refind your faith. And i want you to know its alright to question what you do not understand. I don't think God wants robots to worship him blindly.</content>

        <title type='text'>Yes, the argument that Jephthah is being held up b...</title>
        <content type='html'>Yes, the argument that Jephthah is being held up by the author of Judges as a model NOT to follow is pretty strong, as is the case for God not interfering. This was not an Abraham-Isaac situation where God actually commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are, however, at least three main points which stand out particularly regarding Jephthah's understanding of Torah. (1) Burned sacrfices had to be male (Leviticus 22:18-19) which Jephthah's daughter quite clearly wasn't; furthermore, sacrifice of children was strictly forbidden in the Torah (Deuteronomy 12:31) and there is no other evidence that human sacrifice was carried out in Israel during the era of the judges. Burned sacrifices were clearly linked to judgment/condemnation of evil, NOT thanksgiving to the Lord in the case of fulfilling vows. One final point in this section: at which cultic site would Jephthah have been able to sacrifice his daughter to the Lord? It seems rather unlikely that the priesthood would even sink to this level at this time.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;(2) Jephthah's inheritance, whether his daughter were sacrificed on an altar or wholly dedicated to the Lord's service, would not have been passed on to Jephthah's descendants; so it would go to someone else. Patrilineal precedence or not, this would be a blow to Jephthah.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;(3) As others have noted, why would Jephthah's daughter lament her virginity if she were going to be sarcificed on an altar? Although some figures who were dedicated to the service of YHWH were able to marry (e.g. Samuel), it is not clear that all such people did, or that anyone would be willing to marry the woman anyway. Jephthah's own lineage was not great and he was the leader of an armed gang who went raiding (cf. Judges 11:1-3); add to that the fact that Jephthah's daughter was the victim of a blunder on her father's part - could she be trusted? Like father, like daughter, as the old adage has it. Subsequent female admirers of her noble acceptance of her predicament appear to have celebrated her action rather than "lamented" as many translations have it (cf. Judges 11.39-40). It has been pointed out that the verb often translated as "lament" in v.40 is not the same as used of the daughter and her friends in the first place. A comparable use of the latter verb is found in Judges 5:11 where the righteous acts of the Lord are "recited" or "rehearsed". The NIV translates this verb in Judges 11:40 as "commemorate".&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;All in all, I think the evidence points towards two things: (1) Jephthah wasn't the brightest of people; and (2) his daughter was not sacrificed on an altar, but dedicated to the service of YHWH.</content>

        <content type='html'>Dear Stu et al. I think some of the posts have been quite helpful - but just to clarify a couple of things.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;1 - I think Jephthah did sacrifice his daughter 'He did with her as he had vowed'. Just because it mentions she was a virgin and an only child only heightens the sadness - and why should she go and weep for 2 months if she was only going to be dedicated as a virgin for life? She would have the rest of her life to do this! Also the people dedicated to the temple wouldn't have to stay single. So I think she was killed.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;2 - Jephthah was wrong to sacrifice his daughter. it's showing us how corrupt Israels deliver is.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;3 - Why doesn't God stop him like with Isaac? Well why doesn't God intervene and stop all suffering? Why should God allow any evil to happen if he could intervene? Just because God allow it to happen doesn't mean he approves, nor does it mean he is weak to help. If God came and wiped out all suffering now... well thats another question, but he is biding his time, not wanted anyone to perish but all come to repentance. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;4- It all about Jesus. I think the writer is wanting to show us how flawed all the Judges are, including Jephthah, and how the victory that they rbing against God's enemies doesn't free them from sinning and turning away from God again. Only the rescue of Jesus can do that. Its not a Moses nor a judge, nor King David who can completely rescue us from the power of death and sin. Only Jesus can do that - thats what the story of Jephthah (and the whole Bible) is about. God doesn't require the life of another to do this, he offers of himself in the person of Jesus Christ.</content>

        <content type='html'>A few things I wanna clear up:&lt;BR/&gt;- Wouldn't Jephthah's line have "died out" anyway since only patrilineal descent was considered significant in the OT? (you have only to look at the genealogies to know that: women are almost never mentioned).&lt;BR/&gt;- If the sacrifice in question was simply dedication of Jephthah's daughter to celibacy, then what did Jephthah "do to her"? The fact that Jephthah "did" something to her suggests that the "sacrifice" required some sort of action; it probably wasn't just celibacy, which seems quite passive to me. Did Jephthah perhaps lock her up or perform genital mutilation on her so it would be impossible for her to have sex or something?&lt;BR/&gt;- Has the term "burnt offering" been used figuratively in the Bible prior to this occasion?&lt;BR/&gt;- Why would Jephthah's daughter need the 2 months to "go to the hills and weep" if the sacrifice required was only celibacy? Surely she could still have met up with her friends (especially since none of them were male - "she and the girls" according to NIV) even if she wasn't allowed to marry? (Unless, of course, Jephthah locked her up for the rest of her life, which is a possibility I suggested earlier)</content>

        <content type='html'>I totally agree with Anon#2 and I came to this site looking for a rational explaination of this in the Bible because I'm a Christian and this has always troubled me.  The reason that I am posting at all is to address stu's question of "why did God allow this to happen?"  As a former Christian I'm sure you know that the world as it is today is not what God intended, He intended Eden.  But He gave man a choice.  I think the answer to the question "why don't we live in Eden" must be answered but each of us individually.  I always think on how Pharoah allowed God to take the firstborn of everyone in Egypt.  I know it's easy to say the Pharoah was give 9 other chances to let the Israelites go but think on the Egyptians themselves.  Imagine everyone in Egypt waking up to find there firstborn dead.  Now THAT was an atrocity.  My heart breaks everytime I see "needless" suffering of the "innocents"(the quotes are very important here), but I know God's heart breaks too, and I have to trust him.</content>

        <title type='text'>Hi Stu,&lt;br&gt;I agree with anonymous 2 in what he/she...</title>
        <content type='html'>Hi Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;I agree with anonymous 2 in what he/she says. However, did Jephthah sacrifice his daughter? This has been a point of debate down through the centuries. Personally I don’t believe that he did and I will throw in my evidence for believing that, for what it is worth.&lt;BR/&gt;1. It is a commonly held (and correct) view that the writer of the book of Judges is assessing what happens in the light of the Law. Thus, for example, he will censure Gideon for making an ephod, stating that ‘all Israel went a whoring after it’ and that it was a ‘snare’ for Gideon and his house. The awful conditions at the end of the book will receive the comment that ‘everyone did what was right in his own eyes’. There is no such censure here. Jephthah’s act does not appear to have been as bad as Gideon’s, yet human sacrifice, according to the law, is an abomination to God. It is strange that such a heinous act receives no comment.&lt;BR/&gt;2. According to the writer Jephthah’s vow is made when he is under the influence of ‘the Spirit of the Lord’. &lt;BR/&gt;3. The vow was made deliberately, not on the spur of the moment. That is, it was before Jephthah went into battle not a rash promise made in the heat of battle. I accept the fact that the judges were all seriously flawed, but rationally Jephthah must have known that there was a possibility that what met him when he returned would not be acceptable as a blood sacrifice – either human or an unclean animal.&lt;BR/&gt;4. A lot is made of the fact that Jephthah’s daughter was his only child. It seems strange that when she receives the news, if she is going to die, she wants to spend the last two months of her life on a camping trip with her girlfriends not with her father. What’s stranger is that Jephthah lets her!&lt;BR/&gt;5. Even stranger in her actions is that she is not lamenting the fact that she is going to die or celebrating the life that she’s had so far, but lamenting the fact that she is still a virgin! To do so only makes sense if she is going to be staying alive but remaining a virgin. Similarly the phrase at the end of v. 39 ‘he did with her as he had vowed: and she knew no man’ – why make so much of the fact?&lt;BR/&gt;I’m sure there are more points from the narrative that could be made, but those will do for now. What, then, do I think happened? Jephthah promises that whatever comes to meet him will first of all belong to the Lord. Secondly it will be (literally and very clumsily) ‘caused to go up as an ascending offering’. This particular offering was the only one that was all for God – in the case of blood sacrifices the whole animal went on the altar. I believe that Jephthah’s daughter was to be a ‘living sacrifice’, wholly devoted to the Lord. Hers would be a life of dedicated service and as such she would remain celebate, hence the repeated stress upon virginity and not sleeping with anyone. Jephthah’s letting her go into the mountains for two months makes sense under this interpretation – he would be able to see her again. She wasn’t going to be lost to him completely. Then why the long faces? She was his only child. There would now be no chance of an heir being produced for Jephthah. His family name would die out. This was a cost that he had not envisaged, but he goes through with it and his daughter is prepared to willingly submit to it. Finally it is by no means certain that ‘lament’ is the right translation in verse 40. The word only occurs twice in the Old Testament, the other place being Judges 5 v 11 where it means to ‘rehearse’ or ‘recount’, there used of the righteous acts of God. That being so, it would turn this from a lamentation to a celebration of the devotedness of Jephthah’s daughter and the sacrifice she was prepared to make.&lt;BR/&gt;I throw these thoughts into the ring, for what they are worth. Whilst agreeing with anonymous 2 I don’t personally believe that this story falls into that category.</content>

        <content type='html'>With our modern sensibilities, we recoil from the story.  Why did Jephthah sacrifice his daughter?  Since God would never receive a human sacrifice, does that mean that if we say stupid things we should do them even if it is against what we understand about God?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In this case, an unfamiliarity with the nature of Scripture and how the Israelites used narrative to communicate theology causes us problems in hearing this story. There are many things in Scripture that recount past events that are not meant to be presented as positive or as models for our actions today. The book of Judges is an especially good example of that. The entire book of Judges is basically a negative book to show how Israel failed to live up to what they were called to be as God’s people. It is the negative counterpart to the book of Joshua in which the Israelites did respond faithfully to God. In Joshua, they were faithful and gained possession of the land. In Judges they blended the worship of God with the worship Ba’al and began to lose the land as well as fall under the oppression of surrounding people. Recall, the summary statement of the book of Judges (21:25): "all the people did what was right in their own eyes." For most of the stories in Judges, the point of the story is not made with a single verse summary. We are left to conclude the message of the individual story from the whole context of the book, read in light of this concluding theological statement at the end of the book.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Throughout Judges, most of the leaders (called a shophet, a "judge" or tribal military chieftain) that emerge are seriously flawed. They were only able to accomplish anything because God worked in spite of their failures. For example, Gideon, who is often presented as a hero, was most likely a Ba'al worshipper, was certainly a coward, was greedy, and finally led his entire family into the worship of Ba'al with the result that his entire family was killed. Samson, who is often the subject of heroic children’s stories, was a weak womanizer, and too often drunk, who simply could not control his sexual impulses (Ba'al worship was a fertility religion; see Ba’al Worship in the Old Testament). He ended up a pitiful slave whose final act was suicide. The most positively portrayed of the judges was Deborah, with the deliberate irony that the best of leaders during this period was a woman!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We are supposed to recoil from the monstrosity of Jephthah’s actions. The later community of Israel who included this story in the biblical traditions knew how wrong child sacrifice was, so there would be no mistaking this for a model of right behavior. It would be another example of what happens when God’s people become confused in their thinking about who is really God and how God works in the world. This becomes another lesson for Israel that God will not be manipulated by magical incantations or bargains that we strike with him on our own terms. That is precisely what Jephthah tried to do in making his vow to sacrifice the first thing that met him on his return home, if only God would help him win a battle. God did not need that bargain to aid Jephthah. Jephthah was yet another tragic figure in Judges who had not yet learned enough about God to know that God does not respond to magic or bargains, which lay at the heart of Ba’al worship. Jephthah’s battle against the Ammonites was not won because of his vow, but because of God’s presence (11:32). His lack of faith in God, and understanding of who God is, cost him his daughter.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The biblical traditions recall that as a great tragedy (11:39-40): &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So there arose an Israelite custom that for four days every year the daughters of Israel would go out to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There is nothing positive about the story of Jephthah.  Except it is a heartrending model of what not to do.</content>

        <content type='html'>Hey Matt, thanks for your comment. You must admit though that whatever answer you give to the question, further problems ensue. If it was right to sacrifice his daughter to fulfil a vow, then it would appear that human sacrifice is the right thing to do under certain (specific) circumstances, and that a vow is more important to God than a child's life (in certain circumstances).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I would hope no-one out there believes the above. However, the other alternative is that he was wrong to do it. However, this still leaves God in the position of accessory to the crime, as there was nothing to stop him creating another Abraham/Isaac situation. E.g. "Hey Jephthah, stop! You've proved you're  willing to sacrifice your daughter. Actually, there's no need to do that, sacrifice this ram instead. Well done, go in peace." But nooo. Death to the child. That'll teach him to think twice before he makes a vow. He won't do that again in a hurry.</content>

Until I read the above comments, I'd never heard anyone even come close to claiming this was an example of 'moral' behaviour. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This includes, I think, the writer of the book of Judges (where I think this comes from) who includes the repeated phrase 'in those days Israel had no king and every man did what he saw fit', or summat like that.  Frequently in the bible, what is recorded is not a 'good' example,  but just what happened.  (Issues of biblical reliability nowithstanding).</content>

        <title type='text'>Once again Stu... interesting view points and anal...</title>
        <content type='html'>Once again Stu... interesting view points and analysis... so here is my 2 cents...&lt;BR/&gt; &lt;BR/&gt;Adam and Jesus had exactly the same makeup. Both were descended from God. They both had free will and both could sin.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Did Jesus have the ability to sin. Of course he did, but he chose not too. Yes he had prior knowledge of what was right and wrong, but still he made the decision to remain pure and good. So does this mean that God has the ability to sin, of couse... but he also chooses to remain good and true.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As to the heaven discussion, this is where Catholiscm allows for "the final purification of the elect" in purgatory. I believe (because I have free will) that this is a point that allows us to make a final decision on whether we want to enter heaven, and as such God gives us a final chance to renounce evil. If however we wish to continue to follow Satan we can, all through choice.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This ability to choose is Gods greatest gift. It has also allowed me as you, to analyse Gods work and teachings and to choose whether to follow him, and look to follow a pure and good life, or indeed look the other way.</content>

        <title type='text'>There is a world of difference between Adam who wa...</title>
        <content type='html'>There is a world of difference between Adam who was a created being and the Lord Jesus who had a prepared body and “stepped into time”.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Forget the analogy of the army for a moment (see previous quick answer) and consider that the Lord Jesus came to earth as a bond slave (i.e. one who has no rights). He said, “I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me (John 6 v 38). Was He then a “moral free agent”? He was totally surrendered to the will of His Father.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You make a big assumption in your argument that the Lord Jesus is an “ordinary” man. This is not true. His eternal qualities were not ignored when He came to earth –“God manifest in flesh” (1 Tim 3 v 16).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your argument is like saying because He became a man He was liable to die – as all men do. Again not true. Being a real man meant that He now could die, as indeed He did voluntarily surrender His life, but He didn’t have to die. Death is the wages of sin (Romans 6 v 23). To be a valid Saviour therefore, He has to be impeccable. Anything less will not do for eternal security, for if He were to sin, my salvation would be immediately invalid. I could therefore never have peace if it were possible for Him to sin.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If it was impossible for Him to sin (and I hold that to be so), to what purpose then did the devil “tempt” Him? To see if He could/would sin? If any could find a “chink in the armour” then he could. If any could solicit a response from a latent inward tendency to sin then he could. But he failed. John 8 v 46 “The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in Me.” But surely the real reason for this confrontation was as an outward proof to all that the declaration that God had just made from heaven, “This is My Beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased” was not misplaced. This is borne out by the word “If” that the devil used. Not the “if” of doubt (Strongs number 1437) but the “if” of a fulfilled condition (Strongs number 1487), so that it could be translated “since”. Of course satan knew exactly who He was as did the demons (Mark 1 v 24 “the Holy One of God”)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What is then the meaning of Heb 4 v 15? In every way (all points) that we as real human beings are bombarded with temptations from outside, so was He. But He proved that sin was not essential as part of human life (Rom 8 v 3). The problem naturally, is that when we are bombarded by sin from outside, there is an immediate response from our sinful nature and we sin because we cannot help it. When a person is saved, they are indwelt by God’s Holy Spirit – now there is a contest every time sin comes knocking. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But should there be? If the Holy Spirit is fully in control in the life of the believer, with the old nature given no space to operate then we become more like the Lord Jesus in the ability to resist the external pressure of sin. The question of “unfair advantage” as you put it – and we do need to guard our words here – is negated by the indwelling Holy Spirit.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What about the person who is saved? What happens at the point of salvation? As a “free agent”, I make a voluntary choice to surrender control of my life and hand it over to my Lord, bearing in mind that if He is not Lord of all He is not Lord at all. All real Christians are bondservants. Do we not sing “All to Jesus I surrender”? Is this real or just a platitude? To take this line to its conclusion, I am required to take every decision to Him before it is made for His approval. Hence, I am not a “free agent” anymore – now or ever.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In Heaven there is a complete absence of sin as that place is the home of God who is holy. In any case all sin will be eradicated and put away in the lake of fire with no possibility of it raising its head again, so your posit is irrelevant.</content>

        <content type='html'>Jon, I think we need to be careful here.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You say that Jesus "broke the Law of the time on several occasions", but didn't He say that He had not come to destroy the Law but to fulfil it? If it can be proved that He broke God's Law He would be contradicting Himself.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The laws that you mention are those created by the rulers and traditions of the fathers which were additions to God's Law and man made.</content>

        <content type='html'>Tim, if Jesus &lt;I&gt;could not&lt;/I&gt; sin, he had no free will with regard to moral actions.  I've heard you say that God gave us free will because he didn't want robots, but people who could freely choose to do good.  So are you saying Jesus was a robot?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your army analogy seems quite apt except for two points.  Firstly, &lt;I&gt;you can choose to leave the army&lt;/I&gt;.  Heaven, however, is for ever.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Secondly, if choosing to go to Heaven is like choosing to join the army, then the Christian message is like conscription.

        <content type='html'>Just a brief reply at present. &lt;BR/&gt;I don't like the direction that "logic" is taking on this post.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If the Lord Jesus could sin(regardless of the fact that He didn't), then the whole confidence in His sacrifice on the cross and His ability to save and keep eternally - shatters.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As regards the resignation of free will, this is not an abnormal thing. When a person joins the army he/she resigns free will to take orders. This is a voluntary act of the one who enlists.</content>

        <title type='text'>My main suggestion for you to think about is that ...</title>
        <content type='html'>My main suggestion for you to think about is that you need to consider more carefully your definition of good. What is goodness? Is it defined by God, or as a separate reality to which God may or may not conform? And then is it defined by his nature or by his will?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Without attempting to explore these questions comprehensively here, let us assume that free will is a good, that is, something good in itself. In which case, for God to create beings with free will is a good act - even though that obviously creates the possibility of them doing evil. If those beings then use that free will to do evil, God is not culpable for that because it is a part of the definition of free will that the agent is culpable for his choices. Otherwise it would not have been free will that was created. That is not to say that those beings will necessarily choose evil, only that if they do then it is not God who is culpable, but they themselves. You argue that a good God would not allow the potential for evil to be realised. However, using the definition of good that I am here, that conclusion simply doesn't follow from God's goodness. God was good in creating beings with free will, while how those beings then go on to use that will does not reflect either way on his goodness, but on theirs. I repeat, it is fundamental to the nature of free will that it is the agent who is culpable.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What does reflect on God's goodness, however, is how he then responds to the use of the good free will he has created. I am here making the assumption that justice is also something which is good in itself. In which case God is also good when he justly recompenses the good and evil use of free will. Moreover, his power is in his ability to fully and perfectly execute this good justice, not merely in his ability to prevent the need to for it (which is what you are suggesting). So God is good in creating free will, and good in recompensing its use - I fail to see where he has erred? We can see this more clearly when we compare God to an earthly ruler, who is good when he grants his citizens liberty, and also when he punishes those who misuse it; and moreover is powerful when he is always able to catch and punish wrongdoers. This conclusion is based on the intuitive idea that both freedom and justice are important goods which deserve to be realised.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Yet even that is not the whole story, since as well as freedom and justice, another intrinsic good is mercy (or grace). Yet mercy seems to be in contradiction, or at least strong tension, with justice. The mystery of God, and indeed not only of God but of human life and society in general, is how all three of these goods can be realised simultaneously, and indeed, perfectly. That mystery is precisely what Christians believe has been revealed and explained in the Gospel.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My point is not that this answer is simple or straighforward, but that it occurs within a framework in which the intrinsic goods of freedom, justice and mercy are all held to be deserving of perfect realisation. Within such a framework, God's goodness is in his propensity to do this. This complex definition of goodness means that the simple logic of the problem of evil fails. This means that if you reject the Christian position you must do it not because of the logic of the argument, but because you reject the Christian definition of goodness and the claims it makes about how the tensions within goodness are reconciled ( e.g. the cross). You are of course free to do that (God has created a world in which that freedom is granted you); I just want you to be aware of what you are doing, so that you do not think you can reject it on purely logical grounds.</content>

        <content type='html'>Only a couple of brief thoughts, I'll think more in a little bit.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It is hard for us to understand the combination of God and Man in Jesus. We do not know what he knew while in human form. We do know that his understanding of sin was different to the religious authorities of the time: he broke the Law of the time on several occasions (Sabbath law in particular, also purity laws of mixing with "sinners", even disobeying his parents wishes.) His moral code was based on pleasing and honouring God, leading people to understand God better. A less legalistic definition of sin is "separation from God" Jesus had no separation from God "by definition", therefore could not "sin".&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Resisting temptation is another issue. Jesus had freewill, or his example is meaningless. He (as God) had a different understaning of the world and his purpose to any other human being. He already knew the lessons we use the stories of resisting temptation to teach. Because he had a more complete understanding he could make a more informed and hence better choice (using the logic discussed in the previous post.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Heaven: what is it. I'm not sure where your definition comes from. Jesus is recorded as having spent very little time discussin what heaven is like or how it works. In fact a lot of the time he taught about heaven it is ambiguous whether the "Kingdom of Heaven" is a present reality or a future goal. "Heaven living" is living like Jesus did: demonstrating in both actions and words what God is like, growing the Kingdom of Heaven. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The ancient Jewish view of heaven (as opposed to Greek and Egyptian mythology) was of a physical resurection to the land they were familiar with at "the last day". We can see this in the respose of Martha to Jesus after her brothers death - "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day." In some of Jesus' stories (eg. the Rich man and Lazarus) and particularly in Revelation, a more metaphysical or "other than earthly" description of heaven is given. What we do know (Rev 7:17, 21:4, Isaiah 11:6 etc) is that the effects of sin will be taken away. This includes the clouding of our judgement that fallen-ness gives us, giving us the "knowledge lie God" that the serpent promisied Eve initially. Then we will know the consequences of our actions and as we have chosen to be in heaven to increase the honour of God we will choose, as Jesus did, to make choices that do that. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;One of the things a close examination of Revelation will bring (other than weird dreams and a headache) is the idea that there will be (at least one) rebellion after the return of Jesus. Perhaps in the resurrection in the physical land there are real choices and still consequences for those who reject Jesus. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There's loads more to think about, I will return to these ideas.</content>

        <content type='html'>Interesting blog Stu... and all the comments are valid. But one thing you are missing is that the bible regards the creation of Earth... not the creation of anything prior. To understand the discussion on the how evil and the devil entered the lives of man we have to understand the origins of evil and the devil.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Ezekiel and Isaiah talk about the devils origins. He was created as the highest ranking of all angels, a guardian cherub of god's holiness. As such God bestowed on him his greatest gift of all - that of free will.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It was this gift of free will that allowed the devil to decide&lt;BR/&gt; - I will ascend into heaven, &lt;BR/&gt; - I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: &lt;BR/&gt; - I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: &lt;BR/&gt; - I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; &lt;BR/&gt;and &lt;BR/&gt; - I will be like the most High.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;All of these actions because he was proud of his creator. As god is all powerful he had the choice to keep free will or abolish free will. As he is all good, it would have been wrong to abolish free will.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It was this free will that gave Satan the freedom to choose his fate. By choosing to be like the most high, he desired to be greater than his creator.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So because of free will - evil was created? Not exactly. In creating free will God did not create evil, it was a choice that the devil made.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;When God created Earth the devil took further actions in his desire to be greater than his creator through the deception of Eve. This has since created the battle on earth between good and evil.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God is good and all powerful, because unlike a dictator, he allows us to make the same decision that he allowed Satan to take - a path of good or a path of evil.</content>

        <content type='html'>I agree with two of the comments already made, that when we start using logic to analyse God, we must be careful to start with scripture, and kep our argument in line with it, as it is how God has revealed Himself and His ways to us.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The other comment I am fully in favour of is that your argument is logically sound, save for the assumption around  the "fully-informed, totally free, intelligent, conscious agent will always choose the moral good".&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If this refers to adam, he was clearly not fully-informed. Had he foreseen the consequences of merely eating an apple, (which lets not forget was disobeying an almighty God) I am sure the free, intelligent and conscious agent would not have taken a bite. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God has not chosen that billions of people perish in hell. He is holy, and as creator of the universe has every right to lay down rules as to how we should live and relate to Him. Where anybody chooses not to conform, He would no longer be a perfect, just and righteous God if  the consequences of that choice were able to be waived. Those who perish, scripture teaches, and logic confirms, choose to do so in the face of an alternative made freely available to all.</content>

        <title type='text'>Firstly, it is important in discussions like this ...</title>
        <content type='html'>Firstly, it is important in discussions like this that we start from what the scriptures say. Why is it not valid to assert that God is good and all-powerful and pure when we are told this (see Titus 1 v 2; James 1)? Logic cannot tell us what God is like and we are wholly reliant on God to tell us about Himself otherwise we will remain in ignorance.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Secondly, regarding your comment on Adam, scripture confirms that Adam was not deceived. His sin was entirely deliberate. But think of his dilemma. Sin has now entered the world and he has a choice not so much of good and evil, but of love for God on the one hand and love for his wife on the other. I think it a harsh injustice on Adam to think that this was just a simple choice. How subtle satan is! If Adam will not respond to a good or evil choice, he puts him in an agonising position of choosing between God and his wife.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thirdly, God is omniscient and knowing about the sin problem had made provision for it before it happened. We must be clear on this point that it is not His desire that any one should perish (2 Peter 3) and He never consigns any one to hell. If a person finds himself in hell it will not be of God’s doing but the result of a conscious choice on the part of that person to reject God’s way of salvation. As regards the praise of the redeemed, I did not intend to convey the idea that this was the sole reason of God’s apparent inaction, but merely a result in which I for one am happy to participate.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In respect to your final point, why do you assert that “God actively deceives His creatures”? God has told us what He has done in Genesis. If scientists do not consult this record there can surely be no complaints when they come up with the wrong answers.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God created a fully functioning mature creation as evidenced by the fact that Adam was created as a man and not an embryo. On this basis, trees would have rings to evidence maturity and stars would be shining. It seems inconceivable to me that Genesis 1 v 16 would say “He made the stars also”, but Adam would not have been able to see them as another few light years would be needed for their light to arrive. If God can create a star by speaking, there can surely be no question about His ability to make it appear as mature as whatever was His design.</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Tim&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your comments really intrigue me.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Firstly, it's not a valid response to the problem of evil simply to assert that God is good and God is all-powerful, therefore there must be a valid reason we don't know about for the evil we see around us! This begs the question, as it's this very fact of evil that challenges those two assertions.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Secondly, although you posit as I do that if man was created perfect, doing evil would be unthinkable, you  do not make it clear how we get from here to him actually sinning!  As you say, it was only Eve who was deceived, so Adam is still in his perfect state when he eats the fruit. How can this be, if as you say, evil is simply not an option to him?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thirdly, you say that God knew sin would occur and allowed it to happen (despite knowing that billions of souls would be in agony for eternity as a result) simply because this would result in Heaven being enriched by the praise of the redeemed!  I'm sorry to say this leaves me cold.  If you want to worship a God who will happily consign billions of people to everlasting torment in order to improve the quality of the singing in Heaven, then feel free.  If that's what God is really like then he's not getting any worship from me.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Finally, you seem to think it's acceptable to believe in a God who actively decieves his creatures!  Your idea that God would create a tree with growth rings is incomprehensible to me.  Any scientist examining the recently created tree would justifiably come to the conclusion that it was many years old, as this is a universal property of all trees.  What of the light from stars a million light years away?  Has God decieved the scientists here too?  Scientists have built up a consistent and reliable body of knowledge of the nature of light and the distance of stars, verified by countless experiments and observations.  Using this knowledge, if they see light from a star a million light years away, they are justified in saying that the light has taken a million years to get here. If I was a scientist and had to choose between a deduction from two facts we know pretty much incontrovertably about the universe, or or a very small group of crackpots who claim that God has done some jiggery-pokery to make the star appear a thousand times older than it actually is, I wonder which one I would choose?</content>

        <content type='html'>Firstly, we must not let logic run away with us. Logic is a great tool and man has a tremendous faculty for reasoning, but if we start from the wrong point or use the wrong premises, we may well result in error. Take creation for example: if we looked at a tree’s rings on day two following creation, then our reason would quite rightly indicate that we were looking at an old creation – but we would be very wrong!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God is all powerful and all good. These are just two of His intrinsic qualities of which there are many ( Jer 32v27; Matt 19v 17).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God Who is also holy will eliminate evil and put it away permanently in hell (see blogg 1), but in His own good time. He has all the answers and also the power and the ability to make them happen. He is using this interim period for His own purpose.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Anyway, are we really ready for evil to be eliminated? The lives of many today indicate that they are quite happy to cohabit with sin.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Again, we make the assumption/assertion that God should act immediately in many situations. This is particularly true in the matter of prayer where we expect instant results. I guess this just shows our humanity and how out of touch we really are with God’s purposes when we question His delay.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now we need some clarification here as to terms: -&lt;BR/&gt;1) Perfect – this is derived and is therefore not the same as God’s intrinsic quality. Man was created free from flaw in every way, as was all creation (very good – &lt;BR/&gt;Gen 1 v 31); sinless – but not impeccable. He did not have to sin and there was no bias to sin. We are not told that Adam ever had to choose before the fall. Doing evil was just not an option to him, it was unthinkable. The indication is that Adam would not have sinned but for the woman who was conned (thoroughly deceived – 1 Tim 2 v 14). The problem is that once he had sinned, he did not possess the ability to stop himself sinning again and again. (Rom 7 v 14-25)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;2) Morally Free Agent – the term assumes that for choice a1 or a2 to be made there must be an absolute impartiality, a level field. But sin is a tyrant which binds. Sin is not just an option (a2), it is a bias which Adam did not have prior to the fall. Paul felt the bias only too keenly (Rom 7 – the good that I would I do not and the evil which I would not, that I do). Are these the words of a “morally free agent” with free choice? However, according to Rom 8v3, the Lord Jesus in His life is shown to have condemned sin in the flesh, as a principle. He proved humanity did not have to sin to be human.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God does value when one with a natural bias to do evil makes a deliberate choice to do good – and does it! This of course cannot happen with our own ability because we have none – but by the enabling of His Spirit)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Who then is the devil? He is the highest order of created being. We cannot even see him unless he wants it. (Isa 14 v 12 – Lucifer, son of the morning etc.). But we must be clear that God cannot create evil, otherwise He ceases to be a holy God and the whole of scripture then founders.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now, as regards the existence of evil, it did not take God by surprise – the wonder is that He had already provided for it before creation even took place (Rev 13 v 8: 1 Peter 1 v 20). When evil is present, God can now show us this and we are in a position to understand it! God’s glory is magnified all round in a way it never could have been if He had stopped evil from happening and humanity, co-operating with God experiences even greater blessing.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Why then did God allow evil to enter and to spoil His work? There would have been no praise to God from redeemed hearts and heaven would have been the poorer &lt;BR/&gt;(Rev 5 v 9).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sorry for the essay, but I hope this is useful.</content>

        <content type='html'>If you look in Gen. 3, the Serpent says to Eve "your eyes will be opened". It could be argued that that means they had no concept of morality, right and wrong. They had "been good" because they were surrounded by a place that had no wrong choices. "The Fall" would therefore be the introduction of wrong into the system and the real question would be "where did the serpent come from?". &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your argument hinges on the phrase "surely a fully-informed, totally free, intelligent, conscious agent will always choose the moral good". With this is is hard to disagree, though can you point me out someone who fits that description? &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;No-one is "fully-informed", we can never fully comprehend the results of our actions. Our choices affect much more than just ourselves. How can anyone know in enough detail all the results of a single action to be sure that no bad will come of it? Or that a greater ballance of good than bad will occur? I also started to discuss above the statement "your eyes will be opened". This suggests to me that there was certainly not complete understanding of the implications for Eve, and that perhaps it is the same for us now too.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Totally free implies the complete lack of peer pressure, of worries about family, the power of others (eg police, local gang leaders...) Totally free is a luxury only the rich imagine they have, but do they?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Intelligence presumably means the ability to process the "full information" to its logical conclusion. It depends on the completeness of the previous two clauses as well as the sanity and reasoning ability of the person. We will assume that all humans have the ability to do this while concious.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You say near the end "so temptation would have no power, because however attractive an option might seem in the short term, the perfect, morally free human would always choose the good, no matter what the temptation, simply because it's the better choice." For a perfect human as you described, yes, you are correct. There's just one flaw; as I said above, no-one is perfect like that. Except Jesus. No-one else can truly weight the implications of their decisions, keep entirely free from other people's persuasion, think things though fully.</content>

        <title type='text'>hey what's up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now about the ROCK paradox! ...</title>
        <content type='html'>hey what's up?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;now about the ROCK paradox! its just goes against logic! so why call it logic? I have studied logic, and one way of sloving logical problems is to find an equivalent mathematical form for it, here we go;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;1- God can do anything (create anything) is equivalent to (lets say) x = 5.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;2- Can God create a rock that he can not carry??! ( prove that x + 2 = 10)&lt;BR/&gt;can u? knowing that x = 5???!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;did u got it?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I will tell u something pal! Forget about religion for a while,  and about logic.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Do ur logic accept the theory of relativity?? that time and distance are not absolute and that speed of light is the absolute?? or can ur logic accept the theory of quantum mechanics?? if scientists believed in logic only they would have rejected both theories.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;lsn logic is a powerful tool, but it has its limits.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;U can not learn about God just using this tool, nor u can deny him using it!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;See, now u just do not start with a religion! Try to communicate with this God! He can not be predicted nor seen, but he is the creator of this world.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now if u saw something strange, but u knows it was created by someone, the first thing u will ask is, what is its purpose?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Why God did create us? There should be a reason, u should look for it. See I believe God will help u if u asked him to. Just be honest, do not think about Jesus nor Christianity, Just GOD!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So why are u strict to Christianity, read about different religions that believe in Monotheism. Jews believe that only people whos mother is jew can be Jew. See here:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;http://www.jewfaq.org/whoisjew.htm&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;and see the part about who is Jew!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Muslims although they are stereo-typed for being terrorist are more opened. I mean after all 1.5 billion are muslim. if they were terorists, then one of every 4 persons is bad guy (assuming that there rest 4.5 billion are all good) but I was really surprised that Islamic countries have the least crimes rates world wide.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So now I am doing readings about it! do not read commercial books nor the internet. Use books that were published by professors. They are objective!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;read about Judaism too! and tell me what u think!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;read about Judaism too! and tell me what u think! they are the only two religions I would trust after Christianity!</content>

        <content type='html'>thanks stu!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;i lived for two years with a guy, a christian, who woudl answer that one with the nonsensical "yes, and he could lift it", which betrays the problem with much of thsi country's experience of christianity: that it will not stand up to proper scrutiny, and that its own adherents are the proof of that in their dogmatic and unquestioning plod towards teh end of the world. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;i am glad that you confirm the answer i've always given, "don't talk such nonsense!" as being the correct one to the paradox you quote!!! and i am also glad that your blog may be helping us believers engage our brains a bit more, in our own belief and also in our dealing with those who have no faith. it's very important to me that we as christians don't treat those who aren't as idiots!!!</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Barry, thanks for posting.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Firstly, I'd like to say that I am aware that many 'resolutions' have been proposed to the many dilemmas and contradictions that intelligent thinkers have found within Christianity.  I have looked into many of these and found a lot of them too simplistic.  Please be aware that I have been thinking about these questions for a while, while I still regarded myself as a Christian, and it was only after finding many of these so-called resolutions to the issues I was facing unsatisfactory that I realised that stepping out of the 'box' of Christianity was for me the only way to view these problems objectively.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;As to the debate on Hell, of course I am aware that there are many different views on the subject, having looked into many of them myself.  My post was geared towards a particular view on Hell which has been the orthodox view for hundreds of years, and which many (if not most) Christians still believe today.  My aim was to highlight some of the problems of believing this view, and to show how I find it to be unsatisfactory.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In every doctrinal area of Christianity there have been a plethora of conflicting views and opinions, many of these have been regarded as acceptable for a Christian to hold, and many have been condemned as heresy.  The doctrine of Hell is no different.  The reason there is, as you say, 'a very real debate' about Hell is that many Christians, very possibly using similar arguments to that which I used in my post, have come to the conclusion that the 'orthodox' doctrine of Hell as a place of permanent, eternal suffering, is in need of serious revision.  In this I would say I have to agree, and if you're one of them, then we're both arguing to the same end, but from different sides of the border.  My point is that if all the problems and contradictions in Christianity were ironed out in this way, then we would have something quite unlike the Christianity of the past 2000 years, and quite possibly one which I would have no problem in believing.</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The greatest mistake you made was in suppressing your doubts. You were gifted with a brain and then thought that as a Christian you shouldn't use it. How long can someone exist in such a state of intellectual limbo. Many people do and by the time the tension causes a snap, great damage has been done, because whereas it could have been a journey of resolving one issue at a time, you are left with a hundred different doubts that create a pervasive feeling that Christianity is a nonsense.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are reasonable answers to your doubts - and in some cases there are reasonable answers that show why a particular issue is not subject to reason - even St Paul accepted that we see through a glass darkly. We cannot reference all possible variables so sometimes the answer will elude us. But I bet it is far less than you imagine.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You also need to accept that many of the things you held to be dear about Christianity were in fact misconceptions and misrepresentations, also accepted blindly by people in your church because they too were scared of doubt and afraid of 'going there' because it might rock their faith.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I can tell you that asking the difficult and awkward questions is liberating. I am glad to se you are now doing so - but I hope it is not too late for you.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;An example is your understanding of Hell. It is one of the least well understood aspects of Christianity and you probably take a view, and do not realise that there is a real debate about it's permanence.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Blacknad (Barry Stephenson).</content>

        <content type='html'>Jon is correct.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Logic is 'the relationship between elements and between an element and the whole in a set of objects, individuals, principles, or events'&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Logic is simply the reasoning method that allows us to understand (in this case) what is a reasonable proposition about God and what is nonsense. The question 'can he make a rock that is so heavy he can't lift it' is sheer nonsense. The two ideas are irreconcilable.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Omnipotence is surely understood to mean all-powerful within the realm of what is ultimately possible.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I do not actually believe that God can create sentient beings with free will that do not have the ability to do things contrary to his will - the two things are logically incompatible. But I still don't have a problem with him being omnipotent and having the ability to impose his will upon those beings at any particular moment - it would simply mean that in that instance he is over-riding their free will.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We have to be wary about what form of scrutiny we subject God to. Trying to Logic Chop to come to an understanding of Him is interesting but ultimately limiting. We may not like it, but it is evidently so.&lt;BR/&gt;Also humanity is fallen and therefore corrupted - this extends to our reasoning. This is why God has to reveal himself - because our reasoning does not lead us to him.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I suppose we could play along with the nonsense and say - 'yes - of course God can create a rock he can't lift... and he can also lift it at the same time'. - and it is just our small feeble minds that can't comprehend how that can be so.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Blacknad</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Thorwald. What you've said is quite right, the contradiction is really between points 6 and 7. Point 8 is actually unnecessary. What I was doing in point 8 was trying to apply the general rule in point 6 to the specific instance c in point 7, so we have two contradictory statements about that specific instance c, one that God can lift it, and one that God cannot lift it.  So I was trying to get the statements to apply to the same object.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The point I'm making is that if you have a 'forall' statement about all objects x, and have a statement there is a specific instance object c for which the 'forall' statement is not true, then obviously you have a contradiction. My formal logic may be a little rusty in places, but the general argument holds.</content>

        <content type='html'>Sorry Stu, but I can't agree with your logic. The contradiction you mention between point 7 and 8 isn't there. Basically, 7 says there exists something that God can create, and (but?) that he cannot lift. 8 states that there exists something that God can create and that he can lift. Those two things don't have to be the same objects, and can easily coexist for both statements to be true. I think the contradiction is between 6 and 7, though I'm not sure if the rules of logic are satisfied well enough to end the proof (by contradiction) there. Despite the logic, I do agree with the outcome!</content>

        <content type='html'>I thought for a minute that wo people were faster than me on the old RSS feeds grabbing your latest posts, but turns out it's spammers. Oh well, kill them, Stu.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm going to reply to this one rather than the first post, both are well written again, and raise some interesting ideas. I totally agree with your points on logic: logic is a tool that can be used to prove the consistency of an argument, its &lt;B&gt;validity&lt;/B&gt;, if you will; not its truth content, its &lt;B&gt;veracity&lt;/B&gt; - a logical argument is literally just letters and symbols.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now to the rocks... What your argument shows is that the rock itself is meaningless. It seems to me that the problem (from your first post) is in the definitions - that it is logically incosistant to pit one of God's faculties against another. Can we ask &lt;I&gt;"Is God stronger than God?"&lt;/I&gt; - no, because God is one, and as Jesus said, a house divided against itself cannot stand. God cannot compete with himself, that is a contradiction of His nature as One. Therefore it is nonsensical to pit one ability of God against another, just as it is nonsensical to ask if God can make a square-circle. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God can make anything that can logically exist, and you showed that a rock that God (as OneWhoCanLiftAnything) cannot lift cannot exist, so since God follows logic, He cannot create it. That is not a limit on omnipotence, but a fact of existance.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So this proves nothing, in the end. Logic is a useful, relevant tool in trying to understand God. Its weakness is that we forget too esily that an argument is only as strong as its premises.</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You wrote, "Somebody asked me the other day why Christianity needed to be logically consistent - why do I think that we can use human logic to talk about spiritual things? What if God's logic is different to our logic? Can't God do the impossible?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are probably many people who hold the belief that God's logic is higher than our logic, so we shouldn't use logic when talking about God. However, this simply demonstrates that they don't understand what logic is."&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm a born again evangelical Christian philosopher and I agree with you on this point. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It actually demonstrates more than a misunderstanding about the nature of logic, it betrays an anti-intellecutalism, that led Mark Noll in his book, 'The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind' to say, 'The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is no evangelical mind.'&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The way that the Holy Spirit works is not manipulative. He does not subvert the will from behind the scenes, he works with truth and solicits/attracts the will of a person through the mind and through the feelings. Feelings are not necessarily irrational, sometimes they are very rational EG. That feeling of being liberated when you finish an exam.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Tom</content>

        <content type='html'>Hi Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Can't really agree with this one.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The correct application of logic disproves Christianity.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We would say the following:&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In a universe consisting purely of physical processes, it is logically inconsistent to say that a man can turn water into wine, walk on water, calm a storm with a command, rub mud and spit into a man's eyes and restore his sight etc.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Full stop.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But if Christianity is true, these things must be possible. We have to accept that God is the enabling factor.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now already God has necessarily transcended our logic, and we have accepted that in order to incorporate Christianity's claims we have had to re-evaluate our application of logic.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So here, our logic had told us that Christianity cannot be true because its claims cannot accord with reality. So what do we do? We allow something else to inform our humanistic reasoning, and include factor x (a God who can make a mockery of the laws of physics) that our logic has not led us to or even allowed, except by suspending the conclusions that logical investigation has led us to.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Therefore logic disproves Christianity unless we allow for something that sits outside of our natural reasoning.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Blacknad.</content>

        <content type='html'>God aside,a s infinite and the Creator and all, He is conscious, and eternal, that is, relates to time in a different way to us mortal beings.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The question I have is, who decided eternity was outside of time? what if it is actually an abundance of time instead?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;a friend of mine once posed the thought that there will be no movement in heaven, as that requires both space and time to happen, so ,a s there is no time in heaven, we would be there, but like statues! &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;nonsense when you read scriptural pictures of heaven, but the problem is a faulty idea of eternity. it is not being outside of time, to my mind: it is an abundance of time that will never end.</content>

        <content type='html'>The question of God existing outside of time and being conscious is debatable.  It's quite possibly the case that what I've said in my post doesn't apply to an infinite deity.  My original point though was about conscious beings (i.e. us) existing outside of time, which I think still applies.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Anyone got any thoughts about this?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Thanks for all your comments by the way, more posts will be coming soon.  I'm quite busy at the moment, so I don't have as much time to think about these things as I did before.</content>

        <title type='text'>Hi Stu,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding God and time. Part of you...</title>
        <content type='html'>Hi Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Regarding God and time. Part of your examination of memory and consciousness is based upon an assumption that God is outside of time and therefore is not in any form of time.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I took the following from godandscience.org. It touches on the issue.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;"Both the Bible and science would indicate that God must exist in more than three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. The Bible says the universe cannot contain God (1), indicating He must exist and operate in dimensions of space and time other than those to which we are confined. The Bible also says God created time and was acting before time began (2), confirming that God exists in at least two dimensions of time. A single dimension of time (a line) has a beginning point and can only travel in one direction. Two dimensions of time (a plane) has no beginning or ending so that a being existing in such a plane would be free to move to any point along any line of time within that plane.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Both of these descriptions of God are confirmed by what we know from science. According to particle physics and relativity, at least nine dimensions of space existed at the creation of the universe. God must be able to operate in all of those nine dimensions in order to have created the universe. A verse from the book of Hebrews indicates God created the universe out of some of the dimensions of space and time which are not visible to us (3). Stephen Hawking, George Ellis, and Roger Penrose extended the equations for general relativity to include space and time (4). Not only space, but also time has a beginning - at the moment of creation. Therefore, if God created the universe, He was acting before the creation of time, indicating He exists in at least two dimensions of time. If God existed in only one dimension of time, then He would have had to have been created at one point. The Bible says God was not created, but has existed from eternity past to eternity future."&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It makes a few assumptions itself, but is very interesting.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Also, it seems to me that asking the question 'is God conscious?' is trying to tag Him with words that apply to us but may go no further. What we understand consciousness to be may just not touch upon the state of existence that God experiences. It may just be far too small and limiting.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Regards,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Blacknad.</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu, &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There is a hole in this argument.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;"consciousness requires memory, memory is storing information, storing information is an event in time; therefore consciousness requires time. Therefore, to speak of consciousness outside of time is meaningless."&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You're making the assumption that you understand all kinds of memory, and that there is not a kind of memory or storing of information that could for example, be timeless and atemporal (no moments of time), for example a kind of memory that you would have to be outside of time to be able to see or perceive that drew some of its data from foreknowledge (no problem if you are timeless).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Tom</content>

        <title type='text'>Highly cool blog Stu.  Massively interesting!  Rig...</title>
        <content type='html'>Highly cool blog Stu.  Massively interesting!  Right..&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'll start with the idea of 'discarding ideas that are self-contradictory'.  The example you give is a good one - a 4 sided triangle is a logically contradictory idea, as the concept is that of a 4 sided 3 sided shape - which is obvious nonsense.  The concept of a 2D shape is one within a frame of reference we understand.  &lt;BR/&gt; &lt;BR/&gt;The distinction is made between that which is 'hard to visualise' and that which is nonsense, which is cool.  It does however raise a question - where we lack a frame of reference to judge concepts by, how can we determine which of those catagories a concept falls into?  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;An example of this is the idea of conciousness as defined above.  Certainly the 'process' described cannot exist outside time.  Of the three stages, the first two mentioned (perception and storage, the third being the conection of the percieved and stored 'item a' with the self) cannot exist as we know them outside of time.  I'm not sure about the third - may a bigger brain than mine solve that one!  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, does the fact we can only concieve of this process working within time prevent an 'outside of time equivalent' from existing?  The definition of conciousness given seems to define conciousness in terms of the necessary features of conciousness in our environment.  'Conciousness exists, therefore this process must be happening', rather than 'this process is occuring therefore we are concious'.  Given this, where does our understanding of this process (thanks, by the way, for putting it down - I'd never attempted thought of it this way before) come from?  I'm pretty sure it must come, at least partially, from our environment - the fact we're 'within time'.  If I'm right about that, the argument from the definition of conciousness to the 'non-sense' of conciousness outside time is circular.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I always tend towards the agnostic when thinking about being 'outside time' - we can't understand it, as it's outside of our universe.  In this case - could conciousness, as we understand it, exist outside of time - no, but does that rule out the idea of conciousness without time - I don't think so.  How interaction between outside and inside of time could happen is another question - Jon's covered that more than I have!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Cheers Stu - enjoyed that.  Have a feeling that you're going to get Lots of long comments if you keep making entries like this - maybe you should institue a word limit!?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;matt</content>

        <content type='html'>Interesting ideas!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;First up, a good definition of how you want to look at these problems, thanks.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The idea that existance depends on change is exceptionally old - Heraclitus for the Greeks and many Eastern philosophers all have said the same thing: nothing that we percieve to exist can be observed to be static or without change: "you can never step into the same river again." Modern atomic science tells us this in greater detail: gases are  constantly in motion, liquids and even solids too, at a molecular level, everything is moving and changing. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This raises the question to me: is this an existential statement, or is it more about the confinement of our senses. Our ability to observe depends on a change in the observed thing - fundamentally at a quantum level, or simply that to touch or taste something we must physically contact it. To smell it it must be giving off something, to hear it it must be moving the air in some way and when we see something, we detect reflected or emitted radiation - each depends on a change in the object. Could we even detect an unchanging (a-temporal) "thing" if it existed?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;That means that if God &lt;EM&gt;is&lt;/EM&gt; "eternal" in the sense of "outside of time" (a-temporal), either (a) it is possible to interact with something that does not change (now interact implies change so this must be false) or (b)anyone who says they have interacted with God is a liar or deluded. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I cannot accept that there can be not interaction with God and visa versa, ther is too much evidence of it, so it must be that the initial assumption is incorrect. God is in at least some part &lt;EM&gt;not atemporal&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now for Jesus to be both man and God, he had to change, grow, interact with people, food, animals, wood, any kind of object you can think of. For God to interact with the world, He has to be able to change it, to move it, but also to react and change and move Himself. Theology tells us that too - God did not &lt;EM&gt;plan&lt;/EM&gt; the Fall, His plan was that He would interact with people in a perfect environment without sin. He &lt;EM&gt;reacted&lt;/EM&gt; to the Fall by putting in place a new &lt;EM&gt;plan&lt;/EM&gt;, one of salvation and a differenct kind of interaction, sacrifice. (I'm not saying it caught God unawares, merely that his desire was never for humankind to sin. He &lt;EM&gt;foreknew&lt;/EM&gt; in NT terms, but it must be recognised that even His interactions, the way we know Him, has changed within written history, several times.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;All this says to me is that our concept of time and eternity is wrong. God is not a being that hs no part on the dimension of time. He is, however, not bound by a &lt;EM&gt;flow&lt;/EM&gt; of time, I believe. One day, we too will be removed from that binding, which perhaps is a result of the fall - causality was only strictly necessary after that event (&lt;EM&gt;on that day "you will surely die"&lt;/EM&gt;). We too will be free to move in a time dimension as God is, an perhaps others will be opened to us too. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In the way that we as material and temporal beings exhibit conciousness, it would seem that Stu is correct. Without order and flow of time, memories cannot be laid down and accessed. But similarly, without a piece of material, we cannot concieve of memories being recorded - whether in our heads, on our hard drives, or even scratched into a cave wall. If &lt;EM&gt;"God is a Spirit"&lt;/EM&gt; and that means acorporeal (without body or material manifestation) then we could ask the same question - how does He store memories? (Wish you could footnote these - I don't think that verse means God has &lt;STRONG&gt;no&lt;/STRONG&gt; material manifestation, merely that a body does not mark Him out - when there is none He is no less or more God.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We must admit that with God, some things are above us, and cannot be understood. How God interacts with time (and I am convinced He does) is a mystery. Where his memories are stored, if where is the right word, is also a mystery. That God "takes time" is not self evident, and must be taken with the view that His interaction with time may be no more  restrained than ours is with spatial dimensions.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Jon&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;P.s. Sorry for the essay, but this is fun. It makes me think in a way teaching excel never could!</content>

        <content type='html'>Tom, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.  I'm arguing against a concept of Hell that involves eternal suffering.  If you or anyone else want to say that Hell doesn't involve eternal suffering, then we're arguing for the same thing.  Whether or not this is bourne out in the original meanings of certain scriptures is beside the point.  The fact is that many if not most Christians have believed this view for the past two thousand years, and many still do today.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;It's hardly a "straw man" argument if the view I'm arguing against has been widely accepted for the majority of Church history.</content>

        <content type='html'>Stu,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So, watch out for the straw man there then. Just because a Christian says that x is part of the doctrine of hell, doesn't mean that it is there in the source data. You need to go back to the theology, into the greek and hebrew and look at the words and context of the descriptions. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Have you ever read the chapter on hell in 'The Case for Faith' - there is an interview with JP Moreland I think. He's an exceptionally useful Christian thinker. You might find that chapter really insightful.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Tom</content>

        <content type='html'>Blog 1 – Hell&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;To start with we must understand that Hell is beyond this life as indeed Heaven is also. They are not expressions of how we feel now but real places.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God is truly transcendent and we are reliant on what He says in His Word because no one else knows about them, nor can men attain this knowledge by their logic. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Incidentally, man is not a finite being but an infinite one, as once conceived he lives for ever. Sins are committed on earth – in a finite amount of time. (A technicality, granted.) &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We must also appreciate what sin is to an absolutely holy God. On what basis could God ever allow sin in His presence? He cannot tolerate sin and would surely cease to be holy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;You know that when Adam was created he was given the parameters to move in and that when he sinned he was not provisionally expelled from the garden but permanently.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sin is inextricably part of our current life and whether we like it or not it has not finite, but infinite consequences. God’s holiness demands this for He cannot be tainted with our sin or be seen to be acting in an unrighteous manner.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We have no way of eradicating sin from our beings, we cannot even clearly identify it (Jer 17v9) – but God knows. So to pass out of time into eternity in such a state, we must be banished for ever. This is not God’s decision it is ours! God sets the rules and we ignore what He says at our peril. If you are thinking what opportunity do some have of hearing this, well that is another question altogether!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But God in His love has worked out the great plan of salvation that satisfies His holy demands. If men go along with this, no one will find themselves in hell. Whatever it would have meant to be in hell for eternity (I do not have the capacity to calculate this), has been compressed into three hours on the cross and dealt with fully and finally by the Lord Jesus. What a tremendous task He undertook and completed!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;God in His mercy has created a place called hell as a final repository for sin and all that is sinful. This means that sin can finally be eradicated from our lives and indeed the new heaven and earth can exist without it. What a prospect of being delivered from the power and effects of sin permanently. All sin will be put away for ever. Sadly though, anyone with their sins not forgiven and put away will also have to be there as there is no where else for them to go. This however is not God’s desire or intention but men by their actions leave God no alternative.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So, you see, hell must be a real and eternal place otherwise sin will always be around.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I hope this helps. No doubt it will raise a host of other questions but please raise them with me so that I can tell you what I understand.</content>

        <content type='html'>There's lots of things i'd like to say here but i'll just pop one thing into the melting pot for now...I believe that Hell is a place of torment where people who originally chose a life without God become more and more sinful as their hatred of God increases day by day - warranting an infinite &amp; eternal punishment. About this i am obviously deeply grieved, yet have to trust it to Him.</content>

        <content type='html'>There are two questions here. The first concerns whether a person's evil actions deserves evil consequences. The second is whether any evil human action can deserve infinite evil consequence.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The first question then: does evil deserve evil. This is certainly the near-universal belief of humanity. On an everyday level, everyone believes that those who hurt others deserve to suffer hurt themselves. Take an extreme example. If a person rapes, tortures and kills a child for his own amusement and he then suffers a calamity which first causes him great pain before killing him, everyone would say that he had got what he deserved (indeed surely less). Now suppose this natural consequence did not follow him killing the child, which it probably woudn't since there is no direct natural connection between killing a child and suffering calamity. This is where the execution of justice comes in. Justice (with respect to punishment) is the artificial connecting of evil consequences to evil actions, where nature is defiicient in doing so itself. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Nature is deficient in justice because it is fallen. If every evil action had its just evil consequence then this would already be hell. As it is, God has mercifully permitted it to continue to exist in a state of deficient justice precisely so that people have an opportunity to be saved from the fullness of justice which will eventually come upon it. In the age to come, there will be a place of perfect justice (hell) and perfect mercy (heaven). In the present age there is a complex mixture, and a choice to be made.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;State justice replaces personal retribution, not because the retribution is wrong in itself (to quote God:"you are to take eye for eye, life for life"), but for the sake of good order, to ensure the facts are clear and the punishment is proportional to the crime (cf. Rm 13, take no vengeance, but leave it to God, of which the statesman is God's administrator).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Saying hell is separation from God is true and Biblical. However, that fact doesn't change two other true things: 1) it is a state of suffering, (neither pleasant nor annihilation), 2) it is what we deserve. To be separated from God is the deserved suffering we receive for our sin. We can view this either as the natural consequences or the artificial sentence, either image will do, but in both cases the result is the same: it is suffering, and it is deserved.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The second question: can a man deserve infinite punishment. The "crime" is the rejection of God and the infinite goodness he offers us. Moreover, we have at least some complicity in causing others to reject this eternal salvation too - precisely who is responsible for others rejecting God is always difficult to ascertain, though we all share some culpability. If anything deserves inifinite punishment this surely does.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Admittedly it's a nasty doctrine. But evil is nasty, and let's not pretend otherwise. Evil is that part of us that will gladly allow or even cause others suffer to satisfy our own desires, whether because of pride, anger, lust, envy or greed. It is a deep, serious and pervasive problem, and if we will not recognise that, repent and receive God's gracious (and paradoxical) salvation then we deserve everything we get.</content>

        <content type='html'>I think this depends on whether you think Hell is a punishment by God. I mean, considering all things, being excluded from something appears to be a punishment, because people inherently associate the very essence of goodness with God, ergo, they see going to Hell as a rejection by God, when really it's not about God choosing; I don't think He chooses. Choice is a human thing. God's not human, so I don't think it is sensible to have human emotions applied to Him. He may be merciful, but merciful in the eyes of people; whether he &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; merciful or not is another question.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And all there are are consequences in the this Hell-Heaven system. You can go to Hell, because your actions dictate that that's where you think you'll end up, not that you'll ever know...or you may do.</content>

        <content type='html'>hey guys,&lt;BR/&gt;here are some late night thoughts...&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Some old dead guy something to the effect of the following on his tombstone, &lt;I&gt;If I was God, I could never consign anyone to hell, and God by definition is more merciful than me, and so I am now in heaven!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Despite this being a little facetious, this is actually a powerful arguement. How can an infinitely merciful God inflict eternal suffering? I think there are a couple of possibilities. One is a rather universalist viepoint that I would like to be true, rather than actually think is true. And this is that after one dies we make it up to the day of judgement and everything is revealed and all Christian-type stuff turns out to be true. And then with this absolute proof staring one in the face, God turns to you and gives you one more chance to believe and so, you obviously do. Now this is what I'd like to be true as this way everyone goes to heaven. However, I don't really think it is true.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The underlying problem I see here is the difficulty in imagining an existence without the constraints of time. We cannot do this and so are destined not to make huge progress with this issue. Eternal suffering does not eqauate with lots and lots of time suffering because time does not exist. Justice and all that does demand an eye for an eye etc, and how that sits alongside infinite mercy I'm not so sure. Hmmmm...</content>

        <content type='html'>Good stuff there, Dan. Just to clarify, I'm still clear in my mind that Hell is not a repayment for sins. It seems to me that there can be only one repayment for sins, nothing we can ever do or experience makes any difference to a "balance of good and bad", not even an eternal something. Hell is not about God gaining anything - in fact His greatest desire is that noone should experience it. Hell is not about anyone at all gaining, it's about people losing. Again, no one benifits, least of all Good, by anyone going to Hell. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We think of atonement in terms of "paying a blood price", but I'm not sure that it's helpful. Perhaps we would do better to view the death of Jesus as a key than a coin. Let me explain: what Jesus did in His death and resurrection was to "open a way into the Most Holy Place", like in the OT. Rather than seeing it as paying for the "ferry-man of the dead" to give one billion and four free rides to the good side of the river, it opened a door in an impossibly big wall. Only one key will fit the lock, so we can bring all the other keys we like, they won't open the door. You can't bribe  a lock, you can't climb the wall or break down the door. You can't work up to getting in by being outside for a long time or just by wondering what's inside. Being stuck outside is a matter of pride and choice, since that key is on offer to everyone.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think that whether we look at sin as infinite or binary, it comes to the same thing: if you can't earn your way in in the first place, you can't complain that you've ever paid off your debt however long Hell lasts.</content>

        <content type='html'>When I read this, I am left wondering whether humans are actually finite or whether this is a false premise. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;There are different kinds of actions - while it is true that humans live for a finite number of years, I don't think that they really commit themselves to a finite number of actions. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What I am trying to get at I think comes across well in Ulysses by James Joyce - consciousness and decision is like a stream that flows unendingly down a slope - it is not a series of discrete packets of water flowing one after another down a slope. It is like the difference between the integers and the real numbers. While there are a finite number of integers between 0 and 60, there are an infinite number of real numbers between 0 and 60. I think decision is far more like the real numbers. So I have no problem with saying that in my life I take an infinite number of decisions, an infinite number of which will we sinful.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think this is actually fairly similar to Jon's view that the decision between life and death in the Christian sense is discrete. I may not make individual discrete decisions - but the whole course of these decisions is leading somewhere. It is either leading to life or death. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I could highly recommend reading 'The Great Divorce' by C. S. Lewis, because I think it is a Christian book that deals with heaven and hell in a convincing way for the philosopher. Heaven is presented as this incredibly real world - so real that you feel like a ghost there - and there are distant beautiful mountains that you must walk towards - and in the course of this learn to live in heaven. But for many people, there is something that prevents them from deciding to take this step of faith and walking off into heaven. The decision is theirs, but they still prefer to remain behind, because maybe they feel hurt by someone, maybe they want to stay around for a society, maybe they can't give up their lust or maybe because they can't stop grumbling. This means that they remain a shadow of what they could be - and end up in hell - which is a tiny, ghost like place, full of people who are no longer grumblers, but just a grumble, for example. The decision about whether they choose to live in heaven is entirely theirs and is essentially the result of a whole set of decisions played out during life. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;While this would appear to be weak on the idea of judgment, I don't really think it is - let me explain. The person seems to decide whether he/she goes to hell/heaven. But actually this is the result of God's grace - he allows his children to make their own decisions about whether to do what he says or not to a certain extent. A Father who did not do this would be seen as a control freak - God is not like this. The thing is that because God is gracious and not a control freak, humans sin, completely and irreversibly - infinitely, because they totally reject God with their whole being - the continuum of decisions they make through their life. So in this they are cut off from relationship with God. So the judgment of God is actually complete and final. The vision of hell in the Great Divorce may not seem to be terrifying - but actually it is the complete destruction of the human soul apart from God. The only reason we do not think it is terrifying is because we are all still sinning and enjoy sin. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Because sin is an infinite thing, it needs an infinite solution - one final solution. If sin was discrete, the Old Testament sacrifices would have been enough to atone for the sinful decisions of the people of God. But because sin is so deeply engrained and finds itself deeply within the continuum of decisions we make as humans, we need a final solution - and God provided this with the death of Jesus - the final and complete atonement.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Jon wrote that he cannot see hell in terms of repayment - but actually in a certain sense repayment is crucial. The severance of the relationship with God, although our own choice, is its own repayment. In this, human legal punishment is merely a poor reflection of the punishment God brings, just by letting the sin be its own punishment. Jesus, on the cross, reached a state of severance from God similar to that we reach as sinners - and defeated it - bringing those who trust in him back into relation to God. While the sins we commit are their own repayment, when we trust in the promise of Jesus, we are brought back into relationship and are given the repayment that Jesus deserves - relationship with God - because we have seen that this is better, more real and we have chosen to trust in him.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now I appreciate that the gospel of Jesus Christ must always remain foolishness to the philosopher of this age as Paul says, but sin is an infinite problem, and Jesus is the only infinite solution.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Hope I haven't said too much,&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Dan</content>

        <title type='text'>You’ve caused me too to question is “what is sin?”...</title>
        <content type='html'>You’ve caused me too to question is “what is sin?” Is it an action not approved of by God, or rather a life choice of rejecting God? That would make, rather than a finite cumulative scale of transgressions, a binary state – you’re either “in sin” or “in Christ”. It sounds biblical to me. Why define sinning as a discreet list of acts, requiring a set of appropriate punishments when in the bible it’s always compared to an “in or out” choice – choose life and live, or don’t bother and choose to suffer. Christian salvation should never be thought of as an account of actions and results, balancing each other out. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So rather than &lt;BR/&gt;     hell &gt; sum(bad actions) 0--death, &lt;BR/&gt;we have&lt;BR/&gt;     if (salvation == 1) { goto heaven }&lt;BR/&gt;     else {goto hell} //since sin == 1&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;If we agree that Hell implies suffering, which I will, we must look at Heaven as a place of refreshment, comfort and peace, as Jesus did. (Jesus always talked about hell in a context of the Kingdom, or heaven.) Take the example of the rich man and Lazarus. Did Lazarus in his meagre existence earn the good things he got in “Abraham’s bosom”? No, no more than the rich man stored up pain for himself. While the story sounds quite karmic, the key to their “after-life” was their “earthly-life” – not a series of actions, but the kind of life they lived. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We’ll come back to types of lives and the choices involved, but this has made me ask whether Hell is really a punishment and what kind of punishment it could be if it is.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;In a criminal context, &lt;I&gt;Punishment&lt;/I&gt; as seen in a "just society" such as we (westerners) would like to create, is about a couple of things: the &lt;I&gt;reform&lt;/I&gt; of the criminal so (s)he can be rehabilitated into society; the &lt;I&gt;restraint&lt;/I&gt; of the criminal so (s)he can no longer damage society.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;However, in our heads, it is often seen as the &lt;I&gt;repayment&lt;/I&gt; of a debt to society, which can be clearly shown to be a fallacious idea. Why would society pay money to support a system where hundreds or thousands of people are isolated and given menial (if any) tasks, unrelated to their skills? What kind of repayment does the society receive, if not the perverse pleasure that people they dislike are caused some kind of pain?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The idea of &lt;I&gt;repayment&lt;/I&gt; is closely linked to the idea of &lt;I&gt;retribution&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;revenge&lt;/I&gt;, dangerous words to bring up in a discussion of &lt;I&gt;justice&lt;/I&gt;. If we see punishment in a social context as a kind of payback for criminal acts we skate dangerously close to anarchy - we can never be compensated for the wrongs done to society, not even if rapists are tortured to death - and what kind of "justice" is served?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;[You can ask quite validly why some crimes are deemed more serious and deserving of longer sentences if not to cause longer discomfort to the "worse" criminals. The obvious answer is that they are a greater threat to society and must be &lt;I&gt;restrained&lt;/I&gt; for longer. It can (or should) be seen that those with the greatest potential to damage society in future (those with the most damaging record and the highest likelihood to re-offend) are given the highest security and longest sentences. Those unlikely to re-offend are rehabilitated gradually, with supervision. Those who are likely to re-offend but not seriously are monitored and released.]&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Even OT justice, as seen in the Mosaic Law, was society based – the punishment for a crime either benefited society to re-balance (the repayment of a theft, for example) or removed the criminal from the society (stoning to death for a murderer), and initially, revenge was to be stopped, although later permitted ( in a similar way to divorce, I think)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So if Hell is a punishment, it must be of the vindictive and retributional type – and we can see that at best that is a dangerous type of justice and for me, not one I can ascribe to God.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I would rather say that hell as place of separation from God; ultimately it is “the second death” rather than “torture in a can”. It is the removal of damaging characters from the perfection of heaven. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The rich man made a choice in life to ignore anyone but himself. Lazarus was even kind to scavenging mongrels, he didn’t even chase them when they hurt him or took food he would’ve loved. In a very simplified way, that is the choice we make – am I the only important one around, or is everyone else more important, and God more than all?&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Heaven is something that you cannot earn, it is a gift. It is accessible to all, especially all of us who have heard of Jesus and his saving power. I would suggest that rather than a punishment for a list of misdemeanours, Hell is about being excluded from the Kingdom, just as you chose in your life. It is the continuance of a choice, and whether there is an opportunity to change that choice after death, I don’t know (see “the Great Divorce”, CS Lewis). I would suggest to you that rather than worrying about individual acts, you look at the direction of your life and see that Hell is more an unpleasant terminal as a conclusion to a bad choice, not payback for upsetting Big Brother once too often.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sorry about the essay!</content>

        <content type='html'>What if a finite amount of sin is worthy of an infinite punishment? Then all sin would universially and justly incur infinite suffering as a fair judgement&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;The question, I guess, then shifts to what is sin and how could something finite merit infinite punishment.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;(I haven't figured out how this site works yet and I'm on metered time here in Oxford.
